**INSTITUTION
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT
PATIENT NAME:  **NAME[AAA, BBB M]
ACCOUNT #:  **ID-NUM 
DATE OF SERVICE:  **DATE[Feb 03 06] 
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: **NAME[TTT SSS] TOWERS
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Abdominal pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis on steroid suppression therapy and chronic pancreatitis presenting with a one-day history of midepigastric abdominal pain and altered mental status.  The patient is a poor historian at this time, but the nephew states that she has become increasingly and progressively lethargic throughout the day and has not performed her activities of daily living, will not get out of bed as she usually does for transfers and has been complaining of more and more abdominal pain throughout the day.  The patient apparently had a very restless night and was getting up often to use the bathroom and was having difficulty with getting around with the home nurse.  The nephew provides much of the history, but the patient is able to provide a limited review of systems.  She states she has had a headache for the past three days that was gradual in onset.  No sudden onset of severe headache.  The headache is mild at this time but still present.  The patient does complain of abdominal pain, midepigastric, and non-radiating.  She denies any back pain, and denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.  No weakness, numbness, or tingling.  No myalgias or joint pains.  No fevers or chills. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
Otherwise negative as reviewed by me.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   
1. Rheumatoid arthritis with rheumatoid lung.
2. Pulmonary hypertension.
3. Systemic hypertension.
4. COPD.
5. Diabetes.
6. Leaky heart valve.
7. Pancreatitis (chronic).
8. Interstitial lung disease.
9. Severe kyphoscoliosis.
10. Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia.
11. Right hip replacement.
ALLERGIES:
SULFA, ERYTHROMYCIN, FOSAMAX, PENICILLIN, CIPRO, ALLEGRA, AND ALL NARCOTICS.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient does not smoke, drink, or use any drugs.  Home health nurse visits 24/7.   
MEDICATIONS:
1. Prednisone.
2. Xanax.
3. Clonazepam.
4. Prevacid.
5. Ursodiol.
6. Verapamil.
7. Singulair.
8. Celebrex.
9. Lasix.
10. Flonase.
Of note, this medication list was taken from a prior H&amp;P as the patient does not have her current medication list with her at this time. 
FAMILY HISTORY:
None.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
Generally, this is a Caucasian female in no acute distress but appears quite lethargic but does answer questions.  Temperature 37.2 orally, pulse 82, respirations 16, blood pressure 102/60, saturations 98% on room air.  The head is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Conjunctivae are without pallor.  The mouth revealed dry mucous membranes and no erythema or exudate.  The neck was supple, no lymphadenopathy, full range of motion, and nontender.  The heart was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs.  Lungs have very decreased breath sounds in the bases bilaterally and very poor inspiratory effort.  
Apical lung sounds are clear bilaterally.  The abdomen is soft with positive midepigastric tenderness with no rebound or guarding.  The extremities showed no cyanosis or clubbing.  The patient has 1+ pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities (pedal up to the shin region) and also multiple joint deformities due to chronic rheumatoid arthritis.  On neurologic examination, cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact.  Sensation was intact to painful stimulation throughout.  The patient has 5/5 hand grip, dorsiflexion, and plantar flexion bilaterally.  The skin is warm and dry.  There are no lesions. 
LAB VALUES:
Sodium 133, potassium 4.8, chloride 80, bicarbonate 45, BUN 17, creatinine 0.4, glucose 83, total bilirubin 0.5, conjugated bilirubin less than 0.1, delta bilirubin less than 0.1, ALT 81, AST 72, alkaline phosphatase 111, GGTP 
25, lactate 1.8, amylase 262, lipase 892, white blood cell count 12.8, hemoglobin 12.0, hematocrit 36.9, platelets 140, neutrophils 56%, bands 37%, lymphocytes 1%, INR 1, PT 9.2, PTT 31.6.   
CHEST X-RAY:
This was a very limited examination due to rheumatoid lung and very small lung fields.  It was a poor inspiratory film, but no acute process was noted. 
IMAGING STUDIES:
CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed severe scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine.  Her abdominal aortic aneurysm appears intact (calcified).  Also, there is an aneurysm of the right common iliac, positive right hip replacement, stool-filled mildly dilated colon, sigmoid diverticula, portions of pelvis could not be fully evaluated due to hardware and artefact, and also positive bibasilar atelectasis. 
ED COURSE:  
IV access was established.  The patient was not given any medications for her abdominal pain due to her multiple allergies and altered mental status.  She did not appear in any acute distress.  The differential diagnosis for this patient includes pancreatitis, UTI, intracranial hemorrhage, and pneumonia. 
CT of the head showed no acute process, and therefore I doubt intracranial abnormality.  The patient does have pancreatitis by labs with an elevated white blood cell count.  There is no abscess on the CT, but this was done without IV contrast.  The patient has a significantly elevated bicarbonate and this seems chronic looking at prior lab values.  Her amylase and lipase are much higher than they have been in the past, and therefore the patient's etiology is most likely secondary to acute pancreatitis.  She was given IV fluids with 1 liter of normal saline here and kept NPO.  She was admitted in stable condition to a non-monitored bed.  The case was discussed with the Benedum Geriatric Attending, as well as the A-Service Attending, and the ED 
Attending and agreed with the management plan.  She was admitted in stable condition. 
DIAGNOSIS(ES):  
1. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS.
2. ACUTE PANCREATITIS.
NOTE:
The urine is pending at this time and, if positive, she will be treated with antibiotics. 
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN ADDENDUM:
I have reviewed the nursing notes.  I concur with their general contents.  I have interviewed and examined the patient myself.  Reviewed the case with the resident.  I concur with his general findings. 
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Abdominal pain and change in mental status.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This patient presents to the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of epigastric abdominal pain times five days.  She has been weak.  She has been lethargic.  She complains of urinary frequency.  She is visibly weak on her presentation to the Emergency Department and as confirmed by her family members, she is somewhat confused.  She has no other acute complaints.   
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
No nausea.  No vomiting.  No headache.  No chest pain.  No shortness of breath.  No abdominal pain.  All other systems are negative.  
PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Rheumatoid arthritis.
2. COPD.
3. Diabetes.
4. Chronic pancreatitis.
MEDICATIONS:
Medications per the nursing notes.
ALLERGIES:
ALLERGIES PER THE NURSING NOTES.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Positive tobacco.  No alcohol use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
General:  Appears well, visibly weak.  
Vital Signs:  Vital signs are per the nursing notes.
HEENT:  Normocephalic atraumatic.  Pupils are equal and reactive.  
Extraocular muscles are intact.   
Neck:  Neck is supple and nontender.  No JVD.
Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds bilaterally.    
Heart:  A 3/6 systolic murmur is noted.  
Abdomen:  Abdomen soft.  Moderate epigastric tenderness.  No guarding, no rebound, or mass.     
Extremities:  Extremities atraumatic.  No pedal edema.
Skin:   Skin is warm and dry.  Fair turgor.
Back Examination:  Severe kyphoscoliosis is noted.
ED COURSE:
We administered intravenous fluids to the patient.
Chem 7 revealed anion gap of 8, creatinine of 0.4.  Amylase and lipase were remarkably elevated at 262 and 892.  Lactate level is slightly elevated at 1.8.  White count is 12.8.   
We performed a CT scan of the abdomen to better delineate the patient's etiology for the patient's symptoms.  Intact abdominal aortic aneurysm is noted.  No acute intraabdominal processes were noted.  CT scan of the head revealed no evidence of intracranial pathology.   
Portable chest x-ray had severely limited views due to severe kyphoscoliosis, but revealed no acute disease.   
I suspect that the patient's presentation is due to exacerbation of pancreatitis today as evidenced by her increased lipase level.   
A urinalysis reveals no white cells and therefore, despite the urinary frequency, I do not believe that this represents urosepsis.   
We have discussed the case with the **INSTITUTION Group.  We feel that she would benefit from inpatient admission and management.   
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS(ES):
1. ABDOMINAL PAIN.
2. ACUTE PANCREATITIS.
3. ACUTE WEAKNESS.
4. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS.
