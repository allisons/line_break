The patient is a **AGE[in 50s]-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhosis, ascites, acute-on-chronic renal failure, and diabetes mellitus who we saw in the hospital (please see my earlier note).  The patient's pain has been controlled by methadone 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. and oxycodone 1-2 tabs p.o. q.4 h. relatively well.  He is supposed to get chemotherapy.  Unfortunately given his renal insufficiency and his general debility, it is unclear how well that is going to work.  He has been DNR/DNI and does not want his life prolonged on machines.  He is to follow up with Dr. **NAME[UUU] or (_______________)*** in palliative care.
