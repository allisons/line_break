REASON FOR CONSULTATION 
Pulmonary infiltrate and worsening hypoxia. 
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS 
**NAME[BBB AAA] is a delightful **AGE[in 80s]-year-old white male who Dr. **NAME[TTT] apparently has followed as an outpatient although I do not see any records in MARS or Cerner.  Apparently any laboratory tests that have been done on Mr. **NAME[AAA] has been done locally in Dr. **NAME[UUU]'s office.  He is a fairly good historian and he tells me that Dr. **NAME[TTT] was treating him for some fungal involvement in his lungs.  It sounds like perhaps a hypersensitivity pneumonitis.  By reviewing his CT scans and chest x-rays, it appears though his pulmonary infiltrates over the short term have been relatively stable.  He has had a CT scan of his chest done by Dr. **NAME[TTT] in **DATE[Mar] of 2006 which shows some evidence of bronchiectasis and some patchy alveolar infiltrates.  There may be some early honeycombing at the lung bases and the findings could be consistent with a hypersensitivity pneumonitis although they are fairly nonspecific in nature.  There was some mosaicism to these infiltrates that could also be seen in bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. 
 
The CT scan of the chest was compared to a prior CT on **DATE[Dec 25 06] and per my reading of both his current and former CT, there was no significant change in ground glass opacifications.   
 
The infiltrates do seem to be somewhat worse than what was visualized on the CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis in **DATE[Sep 2006].  However, his x-ray looked quite abnormal on **DATE[Nov 29 05].  I do not have the details of that hospitalization save for a dictated history and physical.  It did not even seem as though he had much in the way of respiratory difficulties during that admission.  His admission was for weakness, nausea and vomiting.  Discharge summary from **DATE[Apr 9 05] indicated that he had Clostridium difficile colitis.  It was at that time that an ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a possible renal mass, which was confirmed by CT scan of the chest and he has been followed by Dr. **NAME[YYY] for this.  No mention was made of his respiratory status and what may have been found at that time.  The patient is now admitted after laparoscopic ablation of a renal mass.  This was done under general anesthesia.  Afterwards he has had hoarseness and cough productive of yellow, purulent type secretions.  Prior to his admission, he relates two episodes of nausea and vomiting followed by sensation of being warm.  He states the one time he vomited he did feel as though he was choking on his secretions.  This was shortly before his hospitalization.   
 
Mr. **NAME[AAA] leads a very active life and tells me that before his hospitalization he would actively help his brother work on a farm.  He has not worked with silage anytime recently.  He states it has been at least three years since that.  He does mow his extensive lawn with a commercial tractor.  His buddy tells me that Dr. **NAME[TTT] has diagnosed him with some pulmonary disease associated with a fungus.  He can give no further history in that regard.   
 
There is a dictated note by Dr. **NAME[TTT] in the chart that states that Mr. **NAME[AAA] had a "markedly positive hypersensitivity panel".  He was however asymptomatic and desaturated to 90% only with exertion.  He felt this might have been hypersensitivity pneumonitis to thermophilic actinomyces and the fact that he used to live in a house with a musty basement.  His current house is new over the last five years and is not musty.  He has no unusual pets or hobbies.  There is no bird exposure.

A ten system review has been performed.  He is noted to be short of breath.  
He is coughing up yellow secretions.  No hemoptysis or pleuritic chest pain.  
He denied any skin rashes.  As above, otherwise noncontributory or negative.  
 
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
GENERAL  This is a pleasant white male.  He is in no acute distress.  VITAL SIGNS He has had low grade temperatures 99.4.  He is currently on six liters nasal cannula saturating 95%.  His pulse is 97 and regular.  Respiratory rate is 16 to 18 and nonlabored.  Blood pressure is 147/60.  HEENT   Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.  Nasal and oral mucosa moist.  No oropharyngeal lesions.  NECK:  Supple.  Full range of motion.  No jugular venous distention, thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.  LUNGS:   Bibasilar rales.  No wheezes or rhonchi.  Rales one half of the way up bilaterally posteriorly.  Chest wall excursion is equal and symmetric bilaterally.  Trachea is midline.  No accessory muscle use.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm.  I hear no obvious murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  No palpable hepatosplenomegaly.  Normal bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES  Without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  SKIN:   Without rashes or jaundice.  NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact.  Strength is 5/5 in the upper extremities.  SKIN:   Without rashes or jaundice.  He is postoperative status.   
 
LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTICS 
An echocardiogram done in 2005 which showed mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure ranging between 37 and 47 mm/hg.  Left ventricular size and function was within normal limits.  A nuclear stress test done **DATE[Apr 5 07] revealed decreased inferolateral uptake but no reversibility and ejection fraction was 79%.  He has not had an EKG done this admission.   
 
Electrolytes were within normal limits.  BUN and creatinine were 27 and 1.6.  
Glucose is 110.  Albumin is 2.8.  White count was 16.9.  Hemoglobin and hematocrit were 12.7 and 36.5.   
 
IMPRESSION 
This patient has baseline abnormalities on his CT scan as mentioned above.  
He has some mild fibrotic changes with honeycombing, but he also has patchy alveolar infiltrates with ground glass characteristics and some degree of honeycombing.  He has a markedly positive hypersensitivity pneumonitis screen and this may in fact represent chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis.  He has not been treated as he has been relatively stable.  No postoperatively he has increasing infiltrates with his current chest x-ray showing bilateral alveolar changes worse in the mid lung fields.  The distribution could certainly represent aspiration pneumonia or it could also represent worsening of his chronic infiltrative lung disease.  I cannot think of any reason why hypersensitivity pneumonitis would worsen acutely postoperatively.  His chest x-ray done on **DATE[Apr 2 2007] just showed some modest changes related to his chronic infiltrative lung disease.  I think more likely would be the case that he may have aspirated during the time of surgery and now has aspiration pneumonia.  It would be unlikely that he has any risk factors for community acquired pneumonia.  I do not think that the radiographic changes and clinical scenario supports the diagnosis of congestive heart failure but a BNP might be helpful in differentiating that.  Given his renal issues and increase in creatinine, and without clearcut evidence of congestive heart failure, I would not diurese the patient any further.   
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
1. Would start him on Zosyn for nosocomial aspiration pneumonia.
2. Sputum cultures have been sent and I would also send blood cultures.  
3. We will do a hypersensitivity pneumonitis screen and some other serologic tests such as an ANCA, etc. to see if we can pin down the etiology of these pulmonary infiltrates if it is not infection.   
4. CT scan of the chest with high resolution cuts will be helpful in differentiating between progression of this fairly specific pattern seen on his chest x-ray versus something more consistent with a pneumonia.  If he worsens despite treatment, we may wish to empirically start him on steroids for the treatment of a hypersensitivity pneumonitis.   
5. Lets recheck a BMP in the morning to assure that his creatinine does not continue to increase.  If it does, I might even hydrate the patient.   
6. A troponin and EKG is also recommended.  
 
Thank you again for this consultation and allowing us to share in the management of this patient.  We will follow with you.
