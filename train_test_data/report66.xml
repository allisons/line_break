CONSULTATION
PATIENT NAME:  **NAME[AAA, BBB M]
ACCOUNT #:  **ID-NUM
**ROOM
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  **NAME[YYY XXX ZZZ]
CONSULTING PHYSICIAN:  **NAME[VVV WWW], M.D.
DATE OF ADMISSION:  **DATE[Sep 15 2006]
DATE OF CONSULTATION:  **DATE[Jun 18 06]  
We are asked by Dr. **NAME[YYY ZZZ] to see this patient in consultation.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Pain.
HPI: The patient is a **AGE[in 50s]-year-old female with coronary artery disease, who was admitted to the hospital on the fifteenth for an emergent heart catheterization after feeling bad at the beginning of **DATE[Aug]. She arrived at the time of transfer to the **INSTITUTION quite irritable and angry with the nurses. This has since resolved. 
She was seen by an Advance Practice nurse yesterday and described phantom leg pain as well as some neuropathic pain in her left arm. This was partially responsive to Darvocet. The patient had been on Neurontin in the past but it had been discontinued because her pharmacist told her that it was bad for her heart failure. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Heart failure. 
3. Diabetes with diabetic retinopathy.
4. Peripheral vascular disease, status post bilateral above-knee amputations. 
5. Renal failure on hemodialysis the past month.
6. Hypertension.
SOCIAL HISTORY: 
She lives in **PLACE with her sister. She has recently lost several loved ones. She does smoke. No alcohol. 
FAMILY HISTORY: 
Family history is positive for coronary disease. 
ALLERGIES:
PENICILLIN, IV DYE, DILAUDID, AND CIPRO. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
Positive for constipation, secondary to a Foley catheter and the pain, as mentioned above. Also, the patient has longstanding insomnia but did notice that she slept after taking an oxycodone. 
MEDICATIONS:   
Medications are in the chart and have been reviewed. She received one tablet of oxycodone last night and started on Neurontin 100 mg b.i.d. yesterday.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
On exam, the patient was sitting up awake and alert, in no apparent distress. 
HEENT exam: Anicteric sclerae, moist mucous membranes. 
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, distant heart sounds. No murmurs were appreciated. 
Lungs: Anterior lung fields were clear. Normal excursion and no accessory muscle use. 
Abdomen: Obese, soft, normoactive bowel sounds, and no organomegaly.
Musculoskeletal: She is status post bilateral AKAs. 
Neurologic: No myoclonus or seizures were noted. 
Psych: Alert and oriented times three, appropriate. 
Skin: No rash. 
LABS: Today, she had a BUN of 42 and a creatinine of 4.9. She had a portable chest x-ray that showed an enlarged heart and some vascular congestion; otherwise, unremarkable portable film. I personally reviewed these images and agree with that interpretation.
IMPRESSION AND PLAN: 
1. Pain. The patient has phantom nerve pain from her amputations. She is responding quite well to Neurontin. We will continue it at 100 mg b.i.d. I have counseled her that it is okay for her to take the Neurontin. 
2. Psychiatric. The patient was quite uncooperative and angry on admission but seemed to have some valid reasons for this. She showed no evidence of psychosis for me. At this time, would not medicate her.
3. Disposition. The patient will find a new primary care doctor and follow up there. 
Will continue to follow while she is in the hospital. Thank you for the consult.
