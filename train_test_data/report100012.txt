ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Assessment: **AGE[in 70s] yo female w/ a h/o ESRD s/p failed kidney transplant, CAD s/p CABG/AVR on coumadin, admitted with bleeding AV fistula with hospital course c/b SAH, small bowel volvulus, GI bleed, and STEMI, now w/ continuing abdominal pain and decreased PO intake.
1. Pain:
a) Abdominal Pain: Unclear etiology for pain - possibly secondary to recent surgery or mesenteric ischemia, as it appears to be exacerbated signficantly by PO intake. Abdominal pain is in good control with current opiate dosage.
b) Hip Pain: Recently had hip replacement. Has pain since then. Says that pain has aggravated though. Given history of bacteremia, there is chance of seeding, however, cultures have been negative for some time so it not very likely.
c) Back Pain: Chronic. Similar in intesity as she experiences at home.
--Patient was initially started on Fentanyl and Hydromorphone PCA, but was not using PCA appropraitely. Therefore was switched to short acting oral hydromorphone for breakthtrough. pain, to which she seems to have responded. Pain is in much better control. Continue the same regimen of fentanyl patch for long acting opiate and dilaudid orally for breakthrough pain.
-- Continue amitriptyline.
2. She also appears to have a mild hypoactive delirium, possibly secondary to her acute illness/hospitalization/pain.
-- Was given 0.5mg Haldol Q8hrs. Reduced **DATE[Oct 31 2009]  to 0.5mg Q12hrs.
-- Mental status has significantly improved. As per daughters this has been the best in weeks..
3. Goals of Care: Met again with patient's two daughters today , including **NAME[VVV] who has been the primary spokesperson. Goals of care were discussed.
-- Patient wants to focus on two things: Pain control and staying at home.
-- Does not want artificial support, and wants to be DNR/DNI. Does not want feeding tube.
-- Prefers symptomatic relief and staying with family over life prolongation.
-- Both patient and family does not want the patient to go to a nursing home. 
-- It was decided that it will be appropraite to transfer patient to TCU for continuation of her IV antibiotics. Patient has a prognosis of weeks to months and it was communicated to the daughters. We will continue to follow the patient at TCU as well where we will help the patient and family in making decision regarding future goals of healthcare, including possible home hospice.
- In case patient can not be transferred to TCU, as a back up plan, she will be discharged to home with home care nursing. Daughters will be given training regarding administeration of Q4H IV antibiotics. Social worker from the palliative care team, along with family memebers identified the needs of medical equipement, required education and support that family might need in case patient is discharged to home. We will make sure that these needs be met before the patient is discharged to home. Findings and plan was discussed with Dr. **NAME[XXX].
