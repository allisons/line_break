**INSTITUTION
Consultation
Name: **NAME[AAA, BBB]
Acct #: **ID-NUM
MRN: **ID-NUM
Admitted: **DATE[May 04 2007]

Ms. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 60s]-year-old lady whom I know very well.  She has had coronary since back in 2003 and 2004.  She also presented at one time with syncope and required a DVD pacemaker.  I do not have the type of pacemaker in front of me at this time.  Other medical problems include significant obesity.  This patient has gained a lot of weight recently.  She has a history of hypertension.  She denies any diabetes.  She does have hyperlipidemia.
This patient has been in her usual state of health at home.  Apparently, she had a URI about a week or two or ago.  She did get some antibiotics and improved.  She has had a flu shot.  She started developing cough, a little shortness of breath, but no fever or chills.  She just was not feeling right. 
She was nauseated and ultimately came to the emergency room.  She was noted to have a potassium of 3.2.  She had some chest pain that was quite atypical with right-hand numbness and it was more related to her breathing, if not anything else, by my history.  She has now been admitted with a possible unstable coronary syndrome.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Is noted, is significant for significant obesity, degenerative joint disease, and asthma.  This patient also has probably had reflux esophagitis.  All other systems at this point are stable.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam this lady is awake, alert, but she is clearly not feeling well.  She has central obesity.  Her blood pressure is 112/59, heart rate 69, respiratory rate 18.  She is afebrile.  HEENT is negative.  Neck veins are not appreciated.  The carotid upstrokes are normal.  The lungs have decreased breath sounds.  I do not hear any wheezes.  There is an occasional rhonchus.  The heart has an S1, S2.  Abdomen:  Soft.  Extremities: 
1+ edema.
Electrocardiogram reveals sinus rhythm, borderline voltage criteria for LVH, nonspecific ST abnormalities.  There are no acute findings on the cardiogram.
Other labs are significant for a potassium of 3.2, BUN is 16, creatinine 1.1, blood sugar 103, and a hemoglobin of 12.7 with a white count of 12,000.  INR is normal.
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Atypical chest pain and shortness of breath that I think is noncardiac in nature.
2.  History of syncope status post sick sinus syndrome and DVD pacer.
3.  History of coronary disease status post remote coronary stenting.
4.  History of hypertension.
5.  History of asthma.
6.  History of obesity and recent weight gain.
7.  Hypokalemia.
PLAN:  As I stated, I do not feel that this patient's chest pain is cardiac in nature.  I think we have other issues that we need to address right now.  
First, I would like to correct her potassium.  I am going to continue Cardizem for her coronary artery disease and we will certainly continue ezetimibe for her lipids.  We will also check a fasting lipid profile.  We will continue topical nitrates at this point.  I think we are going to need to intensify her lung treatment.  I will put her on some DuoNeb inhalers and probably give her a course of Zithromax if okay with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ].
I will try and get this patient to ambulate.  She needs a lot of modification in terms of her lifestyle.  She needs diet, exercise, and weight reduction.  I am going to get a dietician to see her and we will see how she feels over the next 24 hours.  Hopefully, if this is a upper respiratory infection, we can just send her home.  I do not feel that stress testing is mandatory at this point.  Personally, I do not think she can walk on a treadmill with the way she feels right now and secondly I would not give her Adenosine with her underlying asthma.  I do not want to put her through a dobutamine stress test at this point when I do not have any strong clinical suspicion that we are dealing with a cardiac issue.  This patient's troponin is normal.
We will make further recommendations as the clinical situation evolves.
Thanks for the consult.
