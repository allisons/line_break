SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS
Physical: pt unable to voice complaints.  No symptom issues currently.
Goals of care: Family met with NSGY last night.  Plan will be to proceed with PEG and d/c to SNF.  Family very aware (met with 2 relatives) that current QOL is not acceptable AND they are willing to let time help decide if pt is going to progress to an acceptable QOL which would be living not in a SNF, and needs to be able to interact with family.  Family has planned to reassess pt's status in a month.  They are aware they will need to talk with staff at SNF to have someone help them navigate the system of options if pt makes a recovery or if they choose to focus solely on comfort.
