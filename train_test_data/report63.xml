PULMONARY MEDICINE/CRITICAL CARE CONSULTATION 
 
REASON FOR CONSULTATION 
This is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old male with recent identification of Barrett's esophagus and carcinoma in situ who is now status post transhiatal esophagectomy.  We are asked to see the patient regarding postoperative respiratory failure and critical care management. 
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS 
The patient apparently has had long-standing gastroesophageal reflux.  He underwent endoscopy by Dr. **NAME[SSS] at the end of **DATE[Jan].  This identified a 3 cm column of Barrett's mucosa.  Biopsies showed high grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ with foci suspicious for intramucosal carcinoma.  He had a preoperative evaluation that included pulmonary function testing, which were essentially unremarkable.  His FEV1 was over 3 liters.  There was no evidence of obstruction.  Adenosine stress testing was done showing mild global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of about 44%.  There was no evidence of ischemia.  Today, he underwent operative intervention as described including placement of a jejunostomy tube.  The operative course was apparently uncomplicated.  The anesthesiologist record demonstrates satisfactory hemodynamics throughout.  Operative fluids included 5,700 cubic centimeters of crystalloid, 500 cubic centimeters of colloid, and 600 cubic centimeters of packed red blood cells.  The urinary output was 1,400 cc for the case, and estimated blood loss was 1,100 cc.   
 
The patient was received unreversed and intubated to the intensive care unit. 
 I discussed his intraoperative course with Dr. **NAME[RRR], the anesthesiologist. 
  
 
He emerged from anesthesia slightly agitated and moving all extremities.  
Propofol was initiated for intravenous sedation, which had a satisfactory result.  Hemodynamics remained satisfactory.  Oxygenation was satisfactory on 50% FIO2.   
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY 
1. Gastroesophageal reflux/Barrett's esophagus, carcinoma in situ.  See above.
2. Hypothyroidism.  He is maintained on Synthroid.
3. Coronary artery disease.  He apparently had a myocardial infarction more than 10 years ago.  Recent stress testing is described above.  He had preoperative cardiology evaluation Dr. **NAME[QQQ]. 
4. Hypertension.  
5. Prostatic hypertrophy.  
6. Distant history of seizure disorder.
7. Possible schizophrenia.  He is notably on Celexa and Seroquel.
8. Apparent history of eczema or psoriasis for which he was treated with high dose steroids.  He remains on Cortef.  
 
ALLERGIES 
NO KNOWN MEDICATION ALLERGIES.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY 
He is a lifelong nonsmoker.  His preoperative evaluation noted no alcohol use.  He apparently has been employed as a teacher and athletics coach.  
 
FAMILY HISTORY 
His family history is notable for colon cancer.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS 
His review of systems is unobtainable.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
A comprehensive respiratory examination was conducted and recorded in my handwritten note in the progress section.  In brief, this is an elderly male in no acute distress.  He is sedated.  He is orally intubated.  The endotracheal tube is 23 cm to the lip.  Blood pressure is 120/70.  Heart rate is in the 70s and regular.  Respiratory rate is unlabored.  Breathing with the ventilator is with a set rate of 14.  His neck wound has an exiting pharyngostomy tube.  Auscultation shows equal breath sounds.  There is no wheezing a right chest thoracostomy tube is in place.  The heart examination shows a regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen is with the expected postoperative changes.  Jejunostomy tube is in the left upper quadrant.  The extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  The distal pulses are intact at the dorsalis pedis position bilaterally.   
 
LABORATORY DATA 
Arterial blood gas immediately postoperatively showed following values:  
7.41/33/294/20.  Preoperative complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 13.6. 
 Postoperatively, this was 12.0.  Platelet count is 154,000 postoperatively.  
INR preoperatively was 1.0.  Chemistries preoperatively showed normal electrolytes, BUN of 17, creatinine of 1.0, glucose of 83, and liver injury tests normal.   
 
DIAGNOSTICS 
Chest radiograph was available after his arrival to the intensive care unit.  Bilateral chest thoracostomy tubes are noted.  The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned.  There is a right internal jugular catheter.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or subcutaneous air.  Pharyngostomy tube is appropriately in place, descending to a lower thoracic position in the midline where there is some probable atelectasis or undrained effusion at the left base.  The right lung is essentially clear.  There is some vascular crowding (my interpretation of imaging). 
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 
Mr. **NAME[AAA] has undergone transhiatal esophagectomy today for Barrett's esophagus/carcinoma in situ.  His postoperative course has been satisfactory.  He was transferred directly from the operating room to the intensive care unit unreversed and remaining intubated.  Intravenous sedation has been started with propofol.  He will additionally require intravenous opiate infusion with fentanyl for adequate analgesia.  As he completely emerges from the effects of anesthesia, his sedation can be minimized, and he can be assessed for extubation.  He notably has pulmonary function testing done this past fall, which showed no significant respiratory compromise.   
 
His hemodynamics are satisfactory.  He has a history of coronary artery disease but had a satisfactory stress test about three months ago.  He does have some hypokinesis and decreased left ventricular function with global hypokinesis. 
 
Opiate therapy will be used for analgesia.  He appears euvolemic.  
 
Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis is essential.
 
He is apparently maintained on Cortef.  He should continue getting hydrocortisone intravenously in the postoperative period on a scheduled basis.  This could be titrated over time a basal dose of 20 in the morning and 10 at night. 
 
We appreciate the opportunity of participating in the care of Mr. **NAME[AAA].  
We will follow and assist as able through his hospital stay.
