CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fall with injury to left middle finger and left knee. 
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient slipped on the pavement today.  
According to his family, this was because he was not using his cane and did not listen to his wife.  This was a witnessed fall.  The patient had no loss of consciousness.  He was brought in because of dislocation and deformity of his left middle finger.  He ambulated in although he injured his knee. 
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, cancer, coronary artery disease, and triple bypass. 
 
ALLERGIES:  NONE.
 
MEDICATIONS:  Multiple listed on the chart. 
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with his wife.  He is a nonsmoker.  
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies any antecedent illness, fevers, chills, chest pain, lightheadedness, vertigo, shortness of breath, productive cough, or hemoptysis, abdominal pain, new bowel or bladder difficulties or difficulty ambulating.  Other systems are negative. 
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Normal.
GENERAL:  The patient is awake, alert, and oriented.  He is in no distress.  He is a very pleasant **AGE[in 80s]-year-old man.   HEENT:  Head and neck examination shows no evidence of trauma.  Gaze is conjugate.  He has no nystagmus.  No ketones on his breath.  Pharynx is benign.  He has no stridor, dysphonia, dysphagia, or jugular venous distention.   
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.  He has no CVA tenderness to palpation.  
EXTREMITIES:  He moves all extremities well, but the left hand shows a deformity of the left middle finger which appears to be a dislocation at the PIP joint.  There is good distal blood flow.  The left lower extremity reveals contusion over the left patella.  There is no bony or muscle deformity.  He has full range of motion and a normal gait.   
 
TEST RESULTS:  X-ray of the left middle finger reveals a PIP dislocation.
 
TREATMENT:  Prior to the x-ray of the hand, the patient was given a digital block of the left middle long finger with 1% lidocaine which he tolerated well.  Following receipt of the x-ray, the finger was manipulated and maneuvered to reduce the dislocation.  The patient was able to have full range of motion at the PIP joint and repeat x-ray shows complete relocation of the joint surfaces without any evidence of fracture. 
 
The patient was placed in a Toad splint and also a knee immobilizer to his left knee and is referred to his family doctor for possible referral to orthopedics for followup of these problems.  In the meantime, he will take over-the-counter medications for pain, although he was given a prescription for Tramadol to use as needed.  He appears to understand this. 
 
DIAGNOSIS:  Dislocation of left third finger and contusion of left knee status post fall.
