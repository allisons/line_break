CONSULTATION
PATIENT NAME:  **NAME[AAA, BBB M]
ACCOUNT #:  **ID-NUM
**ROOM
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  **NAME[YYY]  **NAME[ZZZ]
CONSULTING PHYSICIAN:  **NAME[WWW M. XXX], M.D.
DATE OF ADMISSION:  **DATE[Aug 11 2006]
DATE OF CONSULTATION:  **DATE[Aug 13 06]  
REASON FOR CONSULT:
Pain, and to evaluate for home hospice.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 60s]-year-old white male discovered with pancreatic cancer with liver mets **DATE[Apr 2006].  This was an incidental discovery.  The patient works as a timber farmer and got hit in the stomach with a log, got evaluated, and this was found.  He is status post stent for obstructive jaundice and said he was actually doing well as far as pain and his symptoms until a week prior to admission when he became acutely jaundiced with abdominal pain, distention, and fevers.  He went to **INSTITUTION and transferred here for stent exchange.
Hospital course has been significant for an aborted ERCP because of obstruction, pigtail placement, and drainage of ascites.  
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
At the current time the patient says his pain at worst is **DATE[Nov 10].  On average, it is 6/10 and at best is 3/10.  He has some nausea.  He has had no bowel movement in four days.  He does not feel constipated.  He does not feel depressed.  He does have some sweating.  He has lost 100 pounds.  Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.  
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1. Duragesic 50.  (Of note, the patient was actually on Duragesic 75 at home and taking oxycodone roughly three times a day).
2. Clonidine.
3. Unasyn.
4. Insulin.
5. PPI.
ALLERGIES:
NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES BUT DARVOCET GIVES HIM HALLUCINATIONS.  ALSO OF NOTE
 HE IS CURRENTLY ON IV DILAUDID PCA AND HE SAYS THAT GIVES HIM DYSPHORIC
 THOUGHTS AT NIGHT.
FAMILY HISTORY:
No cancer.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
He is a timber farmer.  His wife **NAME[RRR] is at phone number **PHONE.
 Address is **STREET-ADDRESS, **PLACE, PA, **ZIP-CODE.  He has two children, one son lives locally and is a mechanic.  No tobacco.  No alcohol.  No drugs.
  
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Afebrile.  Vital signs stable.
GENERAL:  He is chronically ill-appearing but in no acute distress.  
HEENT:  Moist mucous membranes. 
SKIN:  He has icteric sclerae and skin.  Pigtail site looks clean, dry, and intact. 
Lungs are clear to auscultation.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm. 
Abdomen is very distended.  Mildly tender.  He has minimal lower extremity edema.  
The patient is alert and oriented times three with no delirium.  
LABS:
Of note, the computer system is down so I cannot see if he has labs today.
 However, the labs on admission show BUN and creatinine normal, total bilirubin 6.4, ALT 118, albumin 1.8, and INR 1.3.  
ASSESSMENT:
A **AGE[in 60s]-year-old man with obstructive jaundice with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
  
PLAN:
1. Pain.  The patient is currently suboptimally controlled.  My recommendation would be going up on his Duragesic with 50 to 100 q. 72 hours.  I would continue the PCA at the current time.  From interrogating this PCA, he actually stacks boluses which means that he does not get relief from some of his boluses and pressed many times.  However, he prefers to not go up on the dose at the current time.
2. GI.  For constipation we will use Colace 100 b.i.d. and Senna one b.i.d. 
3. For nausea and vomiting, would use Reglan 10 q.i.d. around the clock.  If necessary would use Haldol 2 q. four hours p.r.n. 
4. Goals/disposition.  I discussed this with the patient.  He clearly does not want any mechanical ventilation or CPR and he is DNR/DNI.  He will continue to get IV antibiotics.  He said he does not want chemo.  His reasoning is that he has seen many friends get chemo and he just thought they had worse quality of life because of it.  He wants to go home and life with his wife with the best quality of life he can have.  I discussed home hospice with him and this is something he is receptive to.  We will get a social work consult to evaluate for home hospice.
