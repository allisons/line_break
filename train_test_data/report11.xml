ATTENDING PHYSICIAN ADDENDUM:
I interviewed and examined the patient, as well as reviewed the resident's history, physical and decision-making processes and concur with them.  I have also reviewed the nursing notes and electronic health records. 
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 50s]-year-old gentleman status post multiple abdominal organ transplant as noted above.  The patient lives in **PLACE but is back in town for a routine visit.  He was scheduled to have a renal biopsy today to check for rejection.  The patient was fine up until this morning when he awoke and has had multiple bouts of vomiting and diarrhea and also chills.  He denies any blood in the emesis or in the stool.  He is on antifungal medication but denies any antibiotics other than his usual Bactrim.  He denies any chest pain or abdominal pain.  The patient reports that he has chronic abdominal pain which is no worse than usual.  He denies any UTI-type symptoms.  He denies headache, vision changes, weakness, or paresthesias.   
Past medical history, medications, and allergies are as noted above.  
Social History:
No tobacco or illicit drug use.  Does report occasional alcohol use.  
Physical Examination:  
Physical examination shows an uncomfortable appearing middle-aged Caucasian male.  Initially, his temperature was 37.8.  This was repeated and it was 39.2.  Heart rate was 108, respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 96/palp.  His blood pressure came up to 130/62.  The lungs are clearly to auscultation throughout.  Heart has a regular rate and rhythm with intact cardiac murmurs noted.  Abdomen shows normoactive bowel sounds, soft with some bilateral lower quadrant tenderness which the patient states is chronic.  Extremities show left-sided PICC line.
