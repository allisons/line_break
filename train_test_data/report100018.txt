DVT Prophylaxis:Heparin
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Assessment: Patient with progression of metastatic colon cancer with mets to liver, spine and new pulmonary nodules, w/ R pleural effusion s/p placement of chest tube, admitted w/ volume overload, acute renal failure, abdominal pain and rising bilirubin. 
1.  Pain Management: Pain control well controlled. Currently she reports that it is 1/10, but her numerical pain assessments are difficult to interpret. She appears comfortable. She has used 5 10mg doses of oxycodone over the past 24hrs. 
-cont. oxycodone 10mg Q3H prn, can consider changing to long acting agent w/ oxycontin 15mg Q12H and keeping the oxycodone 10mg Q3H for breakthrough pain
-steroids are a viable option for further pain control in patient's with metastatic liver disease, but does not appear necessary at this time. 
2. Delirium: Mild. Patient with some difficulty repeating complex phrases and number series and following more complex commands. This may be multifactorial with hepatic encephalopathy, heds, and hospital induced delirium all playing a part. Uncertain of current ammonia level. 
-consider Haldol .5mg TID
-continuing lactulose could help prevent/treat hepatic encephalopathy and prevent constipation from narcotics 
3. Code Status:  DNR/DNI, status changed during current hospitalization 
4.  Palliative care:  Plan is to discharge home with hospice to **PLACE, OH where her sister lives. Patient states that she is anticipating leaving. Husband does not wish for us to reveal the specifics of her illness or prognosis to her. We have asked the patient if she has any questions regarding her current health problems and our present plans and she says no.
-continue w/ hospice arrangements
