HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS 
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is an **AGE[in 80s]-year-old pack per day smoker for 50 years.  He worked as a mechanic and may have had some mineral asbestos exposure with brake linings.  He denies a previous history of COPD, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema.  He has been on no inhalers and no oxygen.  He does note over the past month that he has been somewhat more dyspneic on exertion mostly in the mornings and with climbing a flight of stairs.  There is no cough, no hemoptysis, chest pain, or pleurisy.  He has had no sustained weight loss.  He does have a history of coronary artery disease having stents placed in his LAD and left circumflex.  In **DATE[Sep], he was noted to have some rectal bleeding and underwent a colonoscopy.  He had a 2 x 2 cm lesion in the proximal transverse colon.  
There was also a 4 x 2 cm lesion in near the hepatic flexure.  On **DATE[Mar 10 07], he underwent a right hemicolectomy.

FAMILY HISTORY 
Father died of pneumonia.  Mother died of stroke.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
VITAL SIGNS:  Currently, he is saturating at 91% on 1 liter nasal cannula.  He is saturating 89% on room air.  He has diminished breath sounds at the right base with a few expiratory wheezes.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  
NECK:  No lymphadenopathy.  No thyromegaly.  SKIN:  No rash or jaundice.  
RESPIRATORY:  Trachea is midline.  Diminished breath sounds at the right base.  Few expiratory wheezes.  CARDIAC:  Regular.  Normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Normal active bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES:  No lower extremity edema.     
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS 
A 10-system review, except as noted above, is otherwise negative.  
 
DIAGNOSTICS  
Chest x-ray is reviewed.  There is an enlarging right effusion with some minimal atelectasis.  The PA film is rotated limiting interpretation.  There does appear to be a right pleural effusion.  This appears to track up along the right major fissure  This is compared to **DATE[Mar 12 07] which demonstrates an increase size of the effusion and **DATE[Feb] of 2002 which was a normal chest.  The left pulmonary artery is slightly enlarged.  Of note, he is 7 liters positive since his surgery.   
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is an **AGE[in 80s]-year-old pack per day smoker with postoperative oxygen requirements likely due to right effusion and atelectasis due to volume overload.  He is on Coumadin.  His INR is therapeutic at 2.5.  I have discontinued his subcutaneous heparin and I am holding his Coumadin in the event that he may need thoracentesis.  For now, I would pursue some gentle diuresis.  He is -1.5 liters over the past 24 hours.  I have added 20 mg of IV Lasix daily.  We will check a chest CT.  He should have outpatient pulmonary function tests and tobacco cessation.  I suspect that his oxygen requirements will improve with some diuresis but certainly if they do not, we could proceed with thoracentesis when is INR is lower.   
 
Thank you for the opportunity of participating in Mr. **NAME[AAA]'s care.  Please feel free to call with any questions.
