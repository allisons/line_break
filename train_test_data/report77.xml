Her INR was supratherapeutic, and a CAT scan revealed a posterior fossa clot, and she was transferred to **INSTITUTION for clot evacuation and placement of an EVP.  
Neurologic status has declined over the hospital course.  She was initially able to follow some commands and now is unresponsive to tactile and verbal stimuli.  She has a left hemiparesis with an upgoing left toe.  Her course has been complicated by a hospital-acquired pneumonia treated with Zosyn.
 She was extubated on **DATE[Jul 06 2006] without complications as part of her comfort measures only plan.  We are seeing her to go over goals with the son.
