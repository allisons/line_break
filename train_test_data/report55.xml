ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  **NAME[VVV M WWW]
ADMISSION DATE:  **DATE[May 08 2007]
EVALUATION DATE:  **DATE[May 09 06]
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
The patient is a **AGE[in 60s]-year-old gentleman with a history of metastatic renal cell cancer who receives chemotherapy who had exploratory laparotomy and cholecystectomy on **DATE[Mar 16 2007], after he developed fistula.  It was felt to be cholecystocutaneous fistula.  He has been having pain in his right shoulder for sometime.  He had been worked up by Oncology.  They thought that it was related to metastatic disease, but a bone scan was unremarkable.  We then had an abdominal CAT scan in which they thought there was tumor between the gallbladder and the liver, but then he developed fistula.  He underwent a surgery and his biopsy apparently did not show any evidence of malignancy in that area.  He basically had problems postoperatively with bile duct leak and underwent ERCP which did not show leakage from the bile duct.  It was believed that the leakage was from the gallbladder bed.  According to family's report, he underwent a sphincterotomy.  JP drain was inserted to drain the bile and he was discharged to home in early **DATE[Apr] and his drain was discontinued on **DATE[Apr 26 2007].  He was readmitted to **INSTITUTION on **DATE[Apr 28 2007], with weakness, dehydration, and fevers.  He had a wound culture done which grew out E. coli and Klebsiella.  He was placed on antibiotic therapy.  He continues to have drainage from the cholecystocutaneous fistula.  He was referred to our facility for further management of his cholecystocutaneous fistula. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
1. Status post open in **DATE[Mar 2007].
2. Status post right nephrectomy for renal cancer with metastasis that was over 4 years ago. 
3. Myelodysplastic syndrome.
4. Hypertension.
5. Diabetes.
6. Status post right hip replacement.
SOCIAL HISTORY
He does not smoke or drink alcohol.  He is retired from driving truck.  He lives with his wife. 
ALLERGIES
ALLEGRA, METHEMOGLOBINEMIA BY USING CETACAINE.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
As per the resident note, **NAME[QQQ PPP] in the chart.  My note should be considered linked to hers. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
His blood pressure today, when I checked it is 110/78.  His pulse is 104.  
His respiratory rate is 18.  His temperature is 99.  He is saturation 100% on room air.  HEENT: His oral mucosa is moist.  Neck: Supple.  Thyroid was palpable with fully discrete nodules.  His carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Lungs: Revealed crackles at his right base extending up half way to his lung field.  His heart had a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal borders.  There is no gallop.  His abdomen is soft.  He has a large scar with a significant drainage of clear yellow fluid.  His extremities are without significant edema at this time.  Neuro Exam: His finger-to-nose is on target.  There is no drift. 
LABORATORY DATA
His cell count is 8.1.  His hemoglobin is 9.9.  His alkaline phosphatase is slightly increased.  ALT was 46.  Electrolytes are significant for a decreased sodium of 132 and a potassium of 5.1.  His calcium at the outside hospital was corrected at top normal.  Chest x-ray and EKG are pending at this time. 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
1. Cholecystocutaneous fistula.  Pancreatobiliary is going to try and do an ERCP on him.  He is on the schedule for tomorrow.  We will get further imaging based on what the Pancreatobiliary Service requests.  We will have the Wound Care nurse see him and see if they can give a better collection system.  He had tried ostomy bag in the past, but that was not very helpful.  To see if the ostomy nurse here has any other thoughts.  He is basically now using a barrier and then gauze pads to collect the fluid, but it is causing skin irritation. 
2. Diabetes.  His sugars will be followed and we will continue sliding scale insulin therapy. 
3. Recent febrile illness.  He is on Zosyn for biliary coverage and he is on vancomycin for C. difficile. 
4. Crackles on exam.  We will check a chest x-ray, PA and lateral.  He does have evidence of metastatic lung disease to his chest, may be the etiology. 
5. Malnutrition.  He will need to go on supplements.  We will find out what the Pancreatobiliary Service wants to do with his diet after his procedure tomorrow.  We will really need to push protein.  His albumin is quite low. 
This case is discussed in detail with house staff.  I agree with their note as written.  My note should be considered linked to theirs.
