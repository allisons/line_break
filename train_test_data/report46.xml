CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right great toe injury.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was apparently in an altercation with his father and his right great toe was stepped on.  The patient is complaining of some bruising and swelling of the right great toe with some discomfort.  Incident occurred at approximately 11 p.m.  The patient is en route to **INSTITUTION and is present with **PLACE Township police and both of his parents. 
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Tourette syndrome.
 
MEDICATIONS:  Lithium and Abilify.
 
ALLERGIES:  SULFA.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Child is a student.  He uses tobacco.  He also has a history of marijuana and cocaine abuse. 
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies any other injury with the exception of the right great toe where he is tender at the base and has noticed some minor soft tissue swelling and bruising.  There is no harm to the nail.  Denies numbness or tingling and is able to flex and extend the toes. 
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse is 80, respirations are 18, and temperature is 98.
GENERAL:  This is a stocky **AGE[in teens]-year-old Caucasian male who is quite quiet during the exam.  He does not appear to be in any acute distress and presents to the emergency department wearing a flip-flop. 
INTEGUMENTARY:  The skin is examined.  There is some noted bruising on the dorsal base of the great toe.  There is no open area.  The nail remained intact.

There is minor discomfort reproducible directly at the base of the great toe. 
NEUROVASCULAR:  There is good pulse and sensation.  No pallor.
 
MEDICAL DECISION MAKING:  The patient had an x-ray of the foot which was reviewed by myself and by Dr. **NAME[XXX], and there was no noted fractures; however, radiologist's reading shows that there is a subtle lucency at the medial aspect of the distal phalanx of the great toe consistent with a small nondisplaced fracture and no other fractures are noted.  The patient had his toes buddy taped.  He was offered a metatarsal shoe which he refused. 
 
DIAGNOSIS:  Toe fracture.
 
DISPOSITION:  Ice to the foot, buddy tape, comfortable shoe, and follow up with PCP for recheck.  PCP is Dr. **NAME[SSS] Daily.
