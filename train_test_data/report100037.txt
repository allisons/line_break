In addition pt noted to have numerous somatic sx in context of previously dx depression; concern for ongoing mood DO.
- - - - -
Problem/Diagnosis 1: R shoulder pain; Plan: Hx and exam consistent with R sided rotator cuff injury.   Involve PM&R and PT.  Would begin oxycodone 2.5-5 mg PO q 4 prn for pain.
Problem/Diagnosis 2: R arm weakness; Plan: Distribution of weakness consistent with C7-8 radiculopathy.  Would rec conservative management.  Pt not a good candidate for neurontin given renal insufficiency.  Oxycodone as above.  Again please involve PM&R, PT.
Problem/Diagnosis 3: Plantar fascitis; Plan: Would suggest PM&R for possible local injection in near future (pt received recent IV steroids for rejection).
Problem/Diagnosis 4: R hip pain; Plan: Most likely due to lateral cutaneous nerve injury (which is longstanding).  Rec lidoderm patch.
Problem/Diagnosis 5: Hx of depression; Plan: Pt previously on Elivil but dc'd by PCP in recent past.  Pt has seen Dr. **NAME[TTT SSS] in the past; Palliative Care team will ask her to see the pt on Monday.  May need to consider antidepressant in the future.
Problem/Diagnosis 6: Insomnia; Plan: Rec restoril 1 tab at bedtime (10 pm) and 1 tab with awakening (pt routinely awakening at ~2am)
Problem/Diagnosis 7: R sided weakness; Plan: Remote hx of stroke?  No indication to image now.
Problem/Diagnosis 8: Nausea; Plan: Rec SCHEDULED Zofran and Reglan 10 mg QID x 1 day then continue scheduled Zofran with prn Reglan for nausea
Problem/Diagnosis 9: Hiccups; Plan: Etiology not clear at this point.  Would rec Reglan for hiccups as well.
