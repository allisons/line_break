**INSTITUTION
Consultation
Name: **NAME[AAA, BBB]
Acct #: **ID-NUM
MRN: **ID-NUM
Admitted: 
Date: **DATE[Jun 14 2006]
Dict: **NAME[XXX, WWW]
Attend: **NAME[ZZZ, YYY]
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:  Nocturnal oxygen desaturation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  **NAME[BBB AAA] is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old gentleman, who on **DATE[Jun 8 2007], underwent elective redo open heart surgery with aortic valve replacement and saphenous vein grafting to the right coronary artery.  The patient's post-operative course was uneventful.  He was recovering satisfactorily.  His exercise oximetries on room air were satisfactory.  Last night he had a  nocturnal oximetry which revealed episodic O2 desaturation to as low as 81% on room air.  The patient required a titration to 3 liters of oxygen to maintain a saturation above 90% for the duration of the study.  A pulmonary consultation was obtained regarding the possibility of sleep apnea. 
The patient's sleep apnea review of systems is completely negative.  Prior to surgery, he denied fatigue.  He had no daytime hypersomnolence.  He did not take naps regularly.  He never fell asleep inappropriately.  He had no morning frontal headaches.  He had no significant cognitive decline.  He never complained of being tired when awakening in the morning after a normal night's sleep.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for coronary artery disease, status post bypass in 1993.  He also has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and glaucoma.  He has had a previous left carotid endarterectomy.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Include:
1.  Percocet p.r.n. 
2.  A variety of eye drops.
3.  Zocor.
4.  Pepcid. 
5.  Colace. 
6.  Coreg.
7.  Baby aspirin.
8.  Vitamin C.
ALLERGIES:  THERE ARE NO DRUG ALLERGIES.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a long-time smoker of 1/2 pack a day.  He quit earlier this year.  He has no inhalational exposure.  
FAMILY HISTORY:  Not helpful.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise noncontributory.  His admitting complaints were congestive heart failure in **DATE[Apr], when he was admitted to **INSTITUTION.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Cooperative gentleman, who is thin and well-nourished. He had no abnormal head and neck anatomy, including no reduplication of nasal pharyngeal tissue or no septal deviation.  The lungs revealed a few crackles at the left base.  The right lung was clear.  There were no rales or wheezing.  There was slight prolongation of the expiratory phase.  Cardiac exam revealed a regular rhythm and rate.  I heard no murmur.  There was trace edema of the right donor vein leg.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:  Last chest x-ray revealed minimal basilar atelectasis.
I reviewed last night's nocturnal oximetry.  There was evidence of transient nocturnal oxygen desaturation to as low as 81%.  The clinical significance of this 6 days following open heart surgery is uncertain.  Nevertheless, if the patient manifests nocturnal hypoxemia, this could lead to heart strain in the immediate postop period, and we do not need this.  I discussed this with the patient.  He is unenthusiastic about nocturnal oxygen.  We agreed to repeat the nocturnal oximetry tonight, before we make a final decision whether to arrange short-term home nocturnal oxygen.  I doubt the patient has significant obstructive sleep apnea.  We will hold narcotics tonight to see if this had some adverse effect on his respiratory control overnight.
