DATE OF CONSULTATION:    **DATE[May 03 06] 
 
CONSULTING PHYSICIAN:    **NAME[WWW M. XXX], M.D. 
 
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:     **NAME[ZZZ M YYY], M.D.
 
REQUESTING PHYSICIAN:    **NAME[ZZZ M YYY], M.D.
 
REASON FOR CONSULTATION: 
Abdominal pain and questionable history of Crohn's disease.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
The patient is a **AGE[in 40s] year old white female who apparently was given a diagnosis of Crohn's disease in **DATE[Jan 2007] at **INSTITUTION.  All of her recent care has been at that hospital where she has had several small bowel series, one colonoscopy and several CT scans.  I do not have access to all those records. The patient is on chronic narcotics for history of a drug addiction.  Apparently she did not use intravenous drugs.  She uses pain medicines due to treating depression on her own.   
 
The patient was most recently seen at the hospital in **PLACE 3 days prior to admission here.  Apparently her disease is mainly limited to her small bowel sparing the terminal ileum according to the CT scans I have access to.  According to the patient she had a colonoscopy in **DATE[Apr 12 2007] that showed an "ulcer in my colon".  She has been on varying tapering courses of Prednisone and it is unclear if she had a prolonged course of Prednisone. She is also on Pentasa. Currently she has no nausea or vomiting. She is asking to eat.  She is passing gas. She reports having no bowel movements.  She does complain of severe abdominal pain.   
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
Remarkable for hypothyroidism, depression, anxiety and tubal ligation.  
 
ALLERGIES:
BENADRYL, SULFA, MOTRIN and ASPIRIN.
 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Synthroid
2. Prednisone
3. Pentasa 
4. Cymbalta
5. Librium
6. Vistaril
7. OxyContin
8. Methadone  
SOCIAL HISTORY: 
She smokes a pack of cigarettes a day. She does not drink.
 
FAMILY HISTORY: 
Negative for Crohn's disease.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS 
Negative ten point exam as per the admission note. 
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
She is a cachectic middle age white female in no distress. Blood pressure is 120/60, heart rate 78, temperature 36.1.  SKIN, HEENT:  Normal.  NECK:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  CHEST:  Clear.  CV:  Normal.  ABDOMEN: Soft, non-tender when distracted to deep palpation.  No organomegaly. Bowel sounds are present.  RECTAL:  Deferred. EXTREMITIES:  No edema. NEUROLOGICAL:  Non-focal. PSYCHIATRIC:  Mood, affect and judgement are acceptable.  
 
LABORATORY DATA 
Blood work shows an albumin of 2.4, bilirubin 0.4, ALT 28, AST 8, alkaline phosphatase 88, white blood cell count 14.5, hemoglobin 10.2, hematocrit 31.6, MCV 77.5. 
 
A CT scan done at **INSTITUTION on **DATE[Apr 31 07] showed thickening in the terminal ileum.  CT scan done six days prior showed mild dilation of the small bowel with sparing of the dilation of the terminal ileum. 
 
IMPRESSION:
Abdominal pain. She could have small bowel Crohn's disease although currently she has no nausea or vomiting, no abdominal pain to deep palpation and no diarrhea nor any bowel movement at all.  This could all be chronic abdominal pain with narcotic seeking behavior. 
 
PLAN:
1. Small bowel follow through tomorrow to verify whether or not she has Crohn's disease.  If she does have small bowel disease would treat with a high dose of Prednisone 40 mg a day for multiple weeks before tapering. Apparently looked like before she was having short courses of steroids.   
2. Would try to limit narcotics. She is on a hefty dose of narcotics already. 
3. Check iron studies.
