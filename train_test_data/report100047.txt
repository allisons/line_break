ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Assessment: **AGE[in 70s] yo female w/ a h/o ESRD s/p failed kidney transplant, CAD s/p CABG/AVR on coumadin, admitted with bleeding AV fistula with hospital course c/b SAH, small bowel volvulus, GI bleed, and STEMI, now w/ continuing abdominal pain and decreased PO intake.
- - - - -
Problem/Diagnosis 1: Acute abdominal pain; Primary Dx; Plan: Well controlled.  Needed 0.56mg/hr by pca over last 15 hours.
-increase dilaudid CI to 0.5mg/hr
-continue other meds
Problem/Diagnosis 2: Delirium; Plan: Progressive somnolence from meds and renal failure.  Dialysis stopped.  Prioritizing comfort over alertness.
Problem/Diagnosis 3: Secretions; Plan: No current.  Cont current meds.
Problem/Diagnosis 4: Fever; Plan: No current.  Cont current meds.
Problem/Diagnosis 5: Dry eyes; Plan: eye gtts available.
Problem/Diagnosis 6: Goals; Plan: Will convert to inpatient hospice today.  I will be the attending.  Family realizes we may need to transfer if patient stabilizes but I suspect she will die within 3 days given her continuing GI bleed and having stopped dialysis and all her meds.

Family/PCP Discussions1:  Date: **DATE[Nov 04 2009];  Resident: **NAME[UUU] with pt, two daughters, PNCC, attending physician and palliative care SW.  Discussed pt's continued lack of PO intake, persistent delirium and anemia. Given these findings and poor functional status, prognosis likely days-weeks.  Pt's priorities are being home and symptom control.  Suggested DC home with palliative home care for sx mgmt and continuation of IV nafcillin.  Suggested that at some point, dialysis may become a burden to patient.  Daughter, Robin, notes she is not ready for her mom to stop dialysis.  We discussed the posibility of transitioning to hospice should the pt and her family decide to stop dialysis.  Family agreed that goal is comfort and do not plan on re-admitting pt to the hospital.  We will plan on DC to home Sunday afternoon with Family Hospice and Palliative care providing home palliative care.
