CHIEF COMPLAINT 
Abdominal pain, pancreatitis, rheumatoid arthritis. 
 
PATIENT PROFILE
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 50s]-year-old white widowed female.  
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS 
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] was admitted yesterday to **STREET-ADDRESS. **NAME[TTT] because of back pain and abdominal pain.  She presented to the Emergency Room with increasing mid abdominal pain and back pain over about a three-day duration which became increasingly severe and was associated with nausea, decreased urine output.  She was recently treated for a UTI.  She has known diabetes mellitus as well as other medical problems outlined below.  With respect to the question of rheumatoid arthritis, she reports that the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis was made (again) recently by Dr. **NAME[M]. Diamond at **INSTITUTION, a rheumatologist.  She said that in the 1990s she was told that she had rheumatoid arthritis in Ohio but her husband who was dying at the time told her that she should not take medicines such as methotrexate.  She saw Dr. 
**NAME[SSS] because of increasing pain that was inadequately controlled by Lodine.  She says the pain was fairly widespread including both her hands, feet, knees and back.  The picture is complicated because she has known osteoarthritis particularly of the knees and back.  She has had bilateral arthroscopic procedures including two on the right.  She has had meniscal repair surgery on the right and has received hyaluronic acid injections in her knees in the past.  Additionally she has low back pain which she says limits her activity.  When she tries to stand for more than five minutes, she gets back spasms.  At present, she is not getting radicular pain.  
 
She was taking chronic Lodine for the above symptoms.  She said she has had increasing hand pain over probably several years though she is a bit uncertain.  She was developing increasing left wrist pain attributed to a de Quervain's tenosynovitis.  She was injected and given a splint and got some temporary relief.  She does have poor fist closure bilaterally especially in the morning but she believes she has had that for several years.  She has heel pain and also foot pain particularly along the lateral margins of the metatarsals.  She gets some mid and forefoot pain also.   
 
She does not have Raynaud's phenomenon or psoriasis.  She denied pleuritic chest pain (see below).  She has had a history of GI bleed but no history of inflammatory bowel disease.   
 
Functionally she lives alone.  Her apartment has only one step.  She does have an aide who comes in everyday to help her bathe and prepare meals.   
 
After evaluation by Dr. **NAME[SSS], he placed her on Imuran approximately 30 days ago.  She said the decision not to use methotrexate was based on the fact that "her kidneys don't work normally" although available studies to me show creatinines in the range of 0.7 to 0.8.   
 
There was no apparent response to Imuran in the one month that she has been on it except that when directly questioned she says she thinks there might be less swelling in her knuckles now.   
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY 
Complicated and significant.  It includes:
1. History of COPD.
2. Obstructive sleep apnea for which she uses CPAP at night.
3. Coronary artery disease with history of unstable angina, left main and multivessel coronary artery disease with bypass grafting in 2003 and subsequent chronic pain with a negative stress test.  Some of the pain being thought to be due to sternal instability.   
4. Morbid obesity.
5. Status post remote jejunoileal bypass with subsequent reversal. 
6. History of blind loop syndrome. 
7. Diabetes mellitus.
8. Asthma.
9. Depression.
10. Fibromyalgia.
11. Osteoarthritis.
12. History of cholecystectomy.
13. History of appendectomy.
14. Probable history of alcohol abuse with no alcohol intake in 28 years per the patient.   
15. History of recurring abdominal pain with adhesions and strictures from previous abdominal surgeries.   
16. History of cataract surgery.
17. History of remote upper GI bleeding with "gastritis and ulcers".

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 
There are several questions here.  The first of course is whether the pancreatitis is due to Imuran.  It could well be.  Time wise it fits and it is an occasional complication of this drug.  I would hold it at this time.  She does have a history of gallstones in the past, is status post cholecystectomy and could potentially have gallstone pancreatitis.  She seems to be improving from that perspective and GI will address this further.  
 
She clearly has osteoarthritis of the hands and by history and physical examination has osteoarthritis of her knees and probably her LS spine by history too.  She was told she had rheumatoid arthritis years ago but chose not to treat it at that time and then was recently re-diagnosed with that condition.  She was placed on Imuran reportedly because of question about renal function, in turn probably from her diabetes although records I have suggest reasonable renal function.  It would frankly be difficult to make a diagnosis of RA on the available data at this time but I have to assume the rheumatologist had some additional information (for example hand x-rays and laboratory studies) that more firmly established that diagnosis.  She did have some worsening hand symptoms including left wrist symptoms which would be consistent with that diagnosis.   
 
Her multiple other medical problems have been outlined and are being addressed more appropriate.   
 
From my perspective at this time, I think I would do the following:
1. Hold Imuran.
2. We will get a few basic laboratory studies.  I do not want to repeat the complete evaluation done as an outpatient by other rheumatologist. 
3. Until the pancreatitis resolves, no new medications will be considered for her RA.  It would be likely that that decision will be made on an outpatient basis by her regular rheumatologist, Dr. **NAME[M. SSS].   
4. She would benefit from PT/OT evaluation while she is here once she is medically stable.   
5. Could restart nonsteroidal agent once GI status stabilizes.  
6. We will follow up with you.
