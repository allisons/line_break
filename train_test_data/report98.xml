ANESTHESIA:  General.
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  500 cc.
 
COMPLICATIONS:  None.
 
CONDITION:  The patient remained intubated and was transferred to the intensive care unit for further monitoring. 
 
INDICATIONS:  The patient is a **AGE[in 40s]-year-old gentleman who sustained a crush injury to his bilateral lower extremities during a work-related event when he was crushed between forklift and a bucket, two pieces of machinery used in his work.  He sustained isolated injuries to his bilateral lower extremities distal to his knee, right more severe than left.  The patient was initially brought to the outside hospital and was transferred to the **INSTITUTION for further evaluation and treatment secondary to the extensive nature of his wounds.  On evaluation in the preoperative holding area, the patient has sensation that was intact to light touch on his toes.  He was immobilized in long leg splints.  He has brisk capillary refill to his toes.  
He was able to flex and extend his toes.  Further neurologic exam could not be obtained at that time.  The risks, indications, and benefits, and procedures of incision and drainage of his bilateral tibias and traumatic wounds with possible internal and external fixation were discussed with the patient and informed consent was obtained.  Risks include bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, chronic pain, chronic disability, potential need for additional fixation in the future, the plan for repeat debridements and multiple future surgical procedures, loss of limb, loss of life, and anesthetic complications including death. 
 
DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  On **DATE[Aug 16 2007], the patient was identified in the preoperative holding area.  His bilateral lower extremities were identified as the correct operative sites and my initials were placed.  The patient was then transferred to the operating room and transferred to the operating table in a supine position, and there was difficulty in general endotracheal intubation of the patient and intubation required fluoroscopic guidance.  However, ventilation was maintained during intubation procedure.  
The area was found to be secure, and the procedure was continued.  The patient had previously received Ancef, gentamicin, and ampicillin for antibiotic prophylaxis.  In addition, he received 2 g of Ancef preoperatively since it had been approximately 4 hours since his last dose on admission.  
The patient was brought to the operating room in approximately 8 hours following his injury within acceptable time frame.  The patient's bilateral lower extremities were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  His left lower extremity was addressed first.  On inspection of the wound, there was an avulsed soft tissue flap extending from 12 cm curved laceration over the anteromedial aspect of the patient's tibia.  There was gross contamination of the wound.  There was an anterior cortical defect in the tibia on the side with loss of fractured bone pieces.  Approximately 10-cm of the anteromedial aspect of the tibia was exposed and periosteum was stripped.  Muscle bellies of the anterior compartment, superficial posterior and deeper posterior compartments were exposed.  Muscle in these regions appeared viable with normal color and consistency, good capacity for bleeding, and normal contractility when stimulated with electrocautery.  The wound was thoroughly debrided removing the skin edge, all nonviable tissue, all foreign bodies, and the gross contamination.  The wounds were then thoroughly irrigated with 6 L of normal saline solution containing bacitracin.  At this point in time, a V.A.C. dressing was placed.  The left lower extremity was covered and attention was drawn to the right lower extremity. 
 
On examination of the right lower extremity, there was approximately a 3-cm laceration on the anterior aspect of his tibia over the fracture site proximally.  In addition, there was a large, approximately 20-cm, laceration extending from the anteromedial aspect of the tibia to the posterolateral aspect of the tibia.  Posteriorly within the wound, there was evident damage to the medial gastrocnemius muscle and soleus muscle and periosteal stripping of the tibia posteriorly and exposure of the deep posterior compartment and the neurovascular bundles within this compartment.  There was evidence of gross contamination, clot, and muscle __________ compartment.  In addition, there appeared to be soft tissue defect deep to the skin in the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg.  For further inspection, the anterior tibial wound was extended approximately 10 cm proximally and distally for further exposure of the anterior and lateral compartments.  It was noted that most of the anterior and lateral compartments were avulsed off the anterolateral aspect of the tibia.  There were minimal muscle bellies and musculotendinous units in continuity.  There was evidence of bionecrosis and __________ of the lateral compartment.  In addition, several areas of the avulsed anterior and lateral compartment muscles appeared dusky, necrotic, and friable with minimal capacity to bleed and no evidence of contractility with electric stimulation.  Questionable areas of muscle tissue from the anterolateral and superficial and deep compartments were thoroughly debrided.  All dusky, necrotic, friable, and noncontractile tissue was thoroughly debrided and removed from the wound.  The wound was copiously irrigated with 12 L of normal saline solution containing bacitracin with both pulsatile and gravity lavage.  The posterior tibial artery, the vein, and the tibial nerve were identified in the posterior deep compartment.  These were found to be in continuity.  The external saphenous nerves were also exposed by the traumatic lacerations and was found be in continuity and maintained.  Following irrigation and debridement, 2 large vacuum suction dressings were placed on the wounds of the patient's right lower extremity.  Inspection of the extremities following the procedure revealed that the compartments remained soft.  His extremities continued to have good capillary refill with triphasic Doppler waveforms confirmed for both the deep peroneal and posterior tibial arteries of his bilateral lower extremities.  The patient's bilateral lower extremities were then splinted for immobilization of his fractures.  His left lower extremity was splinted and __________, and his right lower extremity was splinted in a long leg splint, and fluoroscopic views were used to confirm adequate reduction and alignment of his right tibia.  Further fixation or replacement of femur was felt to be unwise at this time secondary to the extensive nature of the muscle damage on his right lower extremity.  
The patient will require multiple future debridements with the possibility of amputation of his right lower extremity if necessary, and muscle debridements will result in dysfunction of the patient's right lower extremity.  Towards the end of the procedure, the patient's electrolytes showed signs of myonecrosis with elevation of the patient's potassium.  The patient's urine remained clear without visible evidence of myoglobinuria.  Secondary to the extensive nature of his wounds, the difficult nature of the patient's airway, his electrolyte changes, and his high risk for further myonecrosis and myoglobinuria, we believe the patient would be best monitored postoperatively within the Intensive Care Unit.  In addition, we had planned to keep the patient intubated until next planned surgical procedure for a second incision and drainage in approximately 2 days.  Anesthesia was in agreement with this plan.  The patient's status was carefully discussed with the Trauma Service and will be monitored by the intensivist and trauma surgeons.  We will initiate Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis, we will follow his hematocrit, and we will follow his electrolytes and renal function.  Secondary to his potential for myoglobinuria and renal damage, we discontinued his gentamicin and will continue the patient on Zosyn for antibiotic prophylaxis.  The patient, otherwise, tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.  He remained intubated and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring. 
 
**NAME[M WWW XXX], the attending physician, was present for all key portions of the procedure. 
 
The patient will remain nonweightbearing on his bilateral lower extremities and return to the OR in approximately 2 days.
