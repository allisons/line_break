ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  MELISSA **NAME[M XXX]
CONSULTING PHYSICIAN:  **NAME[YYY M. ZZZ], M.D.
DATE OF ADMISSION:  **DATE[Oct 31 2009]
DATE OF CONSULTATION:  **DATE[Nov 03 09]
 
 
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
 
I was asked by Dr. **NAME[WWW] to see this patient in consultation. Chief  complaint is symptom management and support.  
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
 
She is a **AGE[in 60s]-year-old female known to our service from a prior admission with  a history of amyloidosis affecting her heart, lungs bone marrow and kidneys.  She had been admitted to the hospital in **DATE[Sep] for a long hospital stay  and had recently been initiated on hemodialysis. She has a cardiomyopathy  related to the amyloid with significant diastolic dysfunction. She was  receiving dialysis as an outpatient and then was readmitted to the hospital  on **DATE[Nov 01 2009] with shortness of breath times a week. She was found to have an  elevated BNP level and an increase in size of her pleural effusion. A pigtail  catheter was placed to drain the effusion and the Renal Team has been working  to remove excess fluid with ultrafiltration. Efforts at hemodialysis have  been limited somewhat by her drop in blood pressure.  
 
One of her main complaints today is of a sharp, stabbing pain at the site of  the pigtail catheter that is not responsive to oral Percocet. She also has a  cough which started three days ago with a lot of secretions. She has been on  Robitussin and has been able to produce some mucus.  
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 
1.  Depression and anxiety. 
2.  Mucormycosis. 
3.  Coronary artery disease. 
4.  Amyloidosis as mentioned above. 
5.  She is status post two bone marrow biopsies.
6.  She is status post bilateral carotid stenting. 
 
ALLERGIES: 
 
1.  LIPITOR.
2.  NIACIN.
3.  PENICILLIN.
4.  AMPHOTERICIN.
5.  ATORVASTATIN.
 
MEDICATIONS:
 
1.  IV Zofran p.r.n.
2.  Guaifenesin.
3.  Ativan.
4.  Remeron at bedtime.
 
FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for a family member with cancer. 
 
SOCIAL HISTORY: She resides with her husband. She has family hospice and  palliative care providing home palliative nursing as well as a visiting  nurse.  
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
 
Positive for fatigue. Positive for shortness of breath. Positive for the  cough. Pain as mentioned above. Positive for chronic anorexia, on tube  feedings, and nausea is somewhat better. The remainder of her review of  systems is negative.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAM:
 
GENERAL: She is lying in bed, awake, alert, pleasant, no apparent distress. 
 
HEENT: She has anicteric sclerae, slightly dry mucous membranes. 
 
CARDIOVASCULAR: Slightly distant heart sounds, 2/6 systolic murmur was  appreciated. She has 1 to 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema. 
 
LUNGS: Anterior lung fields are coarse. Normal excursion. No accessory muscle  use.  
 
ABDOMEN: She has a fluid wave. Hyperactive bowel sounds. She has a G-tube in  place.  
 
MUSCULOSKELETAL No gross joint abnormalities.
 
SKIN: No rash. 
 
PSYCHIATRIC: Alert and oriented times three and appropriate. She is CAM  negative. 
 
NEUROLOGIC: No myoclonus or seizures. 
 
LABORATORY DATA: BUN 38, creatinine 2.5. 
 
RADIOGRAPHS:
 
She had a chest x-ray that showed a small right apical pneumothorax,  infiltrate in the right lower lobe and a small right pleural effusion. I  reviewed those images and agree with that interpretation.  
 
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
 
1.   Cough, related to possible bronchitis or pneumonia. Agree with the  guaifenesin. Would also add Tessalon Perles 200 mg b.i.d.  
 
2.   Pain, related to the pigtail. The primary service had already decided to  start her on some oral Dilaudid. Would recommend 2 to 4 mg as needed. 
 
3.   Chronic nausea. Would continue to Zofran and tube feedings. 
 
4.   Coping and support. We will continue to follow the patient for support.  We will also have our Pet Therapy Service see the patient. 
 
5.   Renal. There is a concern that she may need daily hemodialysis at home.  We will talk with the Renal Team to see whether or not the patient may be  eligible for daily dialysis versus peritoneal dialysis.
