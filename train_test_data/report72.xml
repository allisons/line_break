**INSTITUTION
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT
PATIENT NAME:  **NAME[AAA, BBB M]
ACCOUNT #:  **ID-NUM 
DATE OF SERVICE:  **DATE[Jul 02 06] 
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: **NAME[TTT]  **NAME[SSS]
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN ADDENDUM:  
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Right forearm cellulitis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 40s]-year-old male who presents tonight with right forearm cellulitis.  He notes he was seen out at **INSTITUTION approximately one week prior and was diagnosed with a folliculitis which was drained with a needle.  He notes that he has had persistent swelling and abscess formation since that time.  He has had no fevers or chills.  No distal paresthesias.  He presents to the Emergency Department here to be seen by his transplant specialist.  He also notes that he was at the Waterfront when his car was broken into and "trashed".  He is unable to find a ride home to **PLACE and requests help with this as well.  He has no fevers or chills, no distal paresthesias, no cough, sputum or hemoptysis, no other sick contacts.   
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
As outlined above.  The remainder is negative.  
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Remarkable for the afore-mentioned pancreatic transplant in 2004.
ALLERGIES:
NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. 
SOCIAL HISTORY:
No smoking, occasional alcohol, no illicit drugs.
MEDICATIONS:
Bactrim and Prograf.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
The patient was afebrile at 36.8, heart rate 77, respiratory rate 16, BP 
122/80, and saturation 99% on room air. 
GENERAL:  The patient is a conscious, alert and oriented to person, place, time and events preceding, and in mild distress. 
HEENT EXAMINATION:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  The posterior pharynx was pink and moist. 
NECK:  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy or signs of meningismus.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with normoactive bowel sounds.
SKIN EXAMINATION:  Remarkable for a large abscess in the right forearm approximately 2 inches in diameter with surrounding erythema of 1.5 cm as well.  He is neurovascularly intact distal to this and he also notes to me that he had a small folliculitis on the base of the penis which he "popped".  At this time, there is a small clot formation there; however, there are no other signs of erythema, induration, or acute infection. 
NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:  Nonfocal.
PSYCHIATRIC:  Normal mood and affect.
ED COURSE AND MEDICAL DECISION MAKING:
I spoke with the transplant fellow who came to see the patient.  He would prefer to drain the patient's abscess on the floor, and therefore I did not complete this procedure in the Emergency Department.  However, he did receive Unasyn intravenously for this.  He also had laboratory analyses which were nondiagnostic and a Prograf level is pending at this time.  He will be admitted to Transplant Surgery to 12 North. 
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS(ES):  
RIGHT FOREARM ABSCESS.
