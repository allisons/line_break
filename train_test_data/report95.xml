This is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old female patient, morbidly obese.  She was admitted to the hospital with periumbilical and lower abdominal pain associated with watery diarrhea of 3 days' duration, as well as burning with urination.  This lady has been treated in the past by our service for urinary tract infections and overactive bladder.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has multiple medical problems including cervical radiculopathy, osteoporosis, fibromyalgia, hypertension, COPD, abdominal ventral hernia, type 2 diabetes mellitus.  She has had hysterectomy and cholecystectomy in the past.  

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with her grandson.  She ambulates with a wheelchair or a walker.  She denies alcohol or smoking.  

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to penicillin and Compazine.  

MEDICATIONS:  Gabapentin, Norvasc, Aggrenox, Pepcid, Neurontin, Glucotrol, 
Glucophage, Naprosyn, Forastor, Detrol LA, triamterene, K-Lor, Cartia, 
Lexapro, Advair p.r.n.    

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  RESPIRATORY SYSTEM:  When I saw the patient in the room, she had no dyspnea and no cough.  
CARDIOVASCULAR:  She denies chest pain or palpitations.  
GASTROINTESTINAL:  No change in bowel habits.  
GENITOURINARY:  Dysuria.  She denies urinary incontinence.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse on admission was 122 per minute, blood pressure 205/143, respiratory rate 26 per minute.  
GENERAL APPEARANCE:  The patient is morbidly obese.  She is alert and oriented.  She is a very pleasant lady.  
HEENT:  Negative.  
NECK:  Supple.  
LUNGS:  Clear.  
HEART:  Normal sinus rhythm.  No murmur.  
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  
EXTREMITIES:  No edema.  

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient was seen by **NAME[VVV M UUU], M.D., Gynecology.  He found that this lady had rather severe vaginitis.  He prescribed Lotrisone cream and gel.  The patient states that she has been feeling better; she has less burning.  It appears that her burning is due to contact of the urine with the inflamed vagina rather than due to a urinary tract infection.  However, because of the patient's extreme obesity and her elongated vagina, it is almost impossible to obtain an uncontaminated urine specimen to rule out urinary tract infection.  Therefore, if she is agreeable, we will schedule her for cystoscopy before she is discharged from the hospital.
