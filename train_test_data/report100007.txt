HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 
This is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old man with a history of multiple sclerosis, who was originally transferred **INSTITUTION with melanotic stools. He was found down at his house.  At **INSTITUTION his stay was complicated by Klebsiella pneumoniae, acute renal failure, and upper extremity DVTs. Here his course has been complicated by Clostridium difficile and pneumonia. The patient was trying to decide whether or not to have a PEG tube for feedings as he has been aspirating versus not doing so. Today, he evidently made the decision to not have a PEG tube placed to concentrate on comfort. The Primary Team had a long discussion with both the patient and his sister-in-law today. The patient decided that he would like to focus on comfort and be allowed to eat and drink. The Palliative Care Team was called for help with figuring out the best way for him to drink as he is having dysphagia and aspiration.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 
The patient did have nausea earlier today and was given Zofran, which helped. He denies any pain or any shortness of breath. He states that he is sleeping okay. He is most concerned with being able to eat and drink. He is worried that he will not be able to swallow. He was worried that he will not be able to taste. 
 
PHYSICAL EXAM:

HEENT: His sclerae are nonicteric. He has asymmetry of his lips. 
 
NEUROLOGIC: He is alert. He is interactive. He is appropriate. He does have some slurring of his speech, which makes him difficult to understand at times.

He had a barium swallow study performed on **DATE[Oct 29], which showed gross aspiration with nectar-thickened liquids. 
 
Chest x-ray performed the same day showed a large left pleural effusion, and left lower lobe pneumonia. 
 
IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATION: 
 
This is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old male with multiple sclerosis with deconditioning after upper GI bleed and multiple infectious complications of pneumonia. 
 
1. Goals of care.  This has been discussed with the patient and the Primary Team and also with Ms. **NAME[CCC]. The patient does realize that he is dying and would like to receive comfort care. He is most interested in being able to taste to swallow. We will defer to the Primary Team on further limitation of his medications, especially his Lovenox. His Valium may be changed over to a sublingual for him, or one could also perhaps try Klonopin, which is an oral disintegrating tablet. Ativan also does come in sublingual formulation. 
 
2. Dysphagia. I would encourage the patient to have anything to taste or swallow that he is able to. He is most interested in having vanilla ice cream, and also beer. Given his goals are comfort, there is no reason to deny him these foods. It is possible to order beer in the hospital. The patient was instructed of this, but that also it might happen more easily is a family member were to bring it in. 
 
3. Disposition. The patient will likely not be taking in adequate p.o. intake. His prognosis at this time is unclear. May wish to ask to a hospice nurse to come and evaluate the patient to see if he might be appropriate for an inpatient hospice unit. 
 
4. Symptoms. If he would like our help further with symptom management, please let us know. We will continue to see the patient intermittently. Please call if we can be of help prior. Information for this consult was taken from the chart and from the patient and in discussion with the Primary Team.
