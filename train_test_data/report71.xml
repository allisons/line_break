Chief complaint is back pain. 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 30s]-year-old white male who injured his back several weeks ago.  I personally saw him and treated him at that time and gave him a prescription for Percocet.  This pain was progressively getting better; however, he attempted to lift something today and had the acute onset of worsening low back pain.  He describes this pain as low back pain, nonradiating, dull, achy in nature.  His Percocet has been helping but he no longer has any more.  He has not followed up with a back specialist as I had previously instructed him to and will do so immediately after the holidays.  Otherwise he denies any bowel or bladder incontinence and no neurologic complaints.
