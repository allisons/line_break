Operative Report
Name: **NAME[AAA, BBB]
Acct #: **ID-NUM
MRN: **ID-NUM
Date of Procedure: **DATE[Apr 17 2006]
Admitted: **DATE[Apr 14 2007]
SURGEON:  **NAME[M WWW ZZZ], MD
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Recurrent intracranial tumor.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Recurrent intracranial tumor.
PROCEDURE:  Image-guided reexploration right frontal craniotomy and gross total excision of tumor.
ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal.
INDICATIONS:  Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 60s]-year-old woman.  In 1999 I did a craniotomy and subtotal excision of a tumor.  At the time it was presumed to be glioblastoma.  Later, pathologic specimens indicated something more bizarre.  She was placed in the hands of the brain tumor study group.  At that point in time, monitoring was all that was done.  She returned to my attention 2 years ago with what appeared to be reoccurrence of her her tumor. At that point in time, her husband had passed away.  She declined any surgical intervention.  Over time, I followed her with serial studies.  It was clear that the lesion was enlarging.  She continued to decline undergoing anything surgical.  Finally, she began experiencing worsening neurologic problems.  She and her family decided to proceed with surgery.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the operating room where intravenous and arterial lines were placed.  General anesthesia was induced and the patient endotracheal intubated.  A Foley catheter was placed.  This scalp was then shaved.  The (_______________) for the image-guided system were registered.  The scalp was then prepped and draped in the usual fashion. 

I reopened the old incision.  Raney clips were placed for hemostasis.  I removed the screws that secured the original bone flap.  I was able to simply prior the flap up.  I could immediately see tumor protruding through the dura.  Using the image-guided system, I made a dural opening.  I then proceeded to start the resection of the tumor.  Additionally, it appeared to be predominantly glioblastoma.  I took a number of biopsy specimens.  As things developed, however, it was clear that there was actually a plane around the tumor.  Utilizing this plane, I carefully dissected the tumor free of the underlying brain.  As I progressed circumferentially, I would debulk it at times with the CUSA.  I continued to debulk and dissect until I had essentially removed the entire thing.  There were a few areas where it was adherent to the dura and the falx.  In those locations I simply coagulated things.
Meticulous hemostasis was achieved throughout the resection site.  A layer of Surgicel was placed over the resection site.  There was one area deep where I had come into the ventricle.  This I covered with a piece of thrombin-soaked Gelfoam.  I then closed the dura with a dural graft.  The craniotomy flap was secured with the titanium plates and screws.  A Jackson-Pratt drain was placed to drain the subgaleal space.  The skin was closed with 2-0 Polysorb and the galea and staples in the skin.  Blood loss was about 100 cc.  
The physician assistant was essential for suction, irrigation, and retraction.
