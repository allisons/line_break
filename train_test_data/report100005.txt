Diff Comments, CSF MANY ERYTHROPHAGOCYTES AND LEUKOPHAGOCYTES SEEN ON SCANNING A SMALL CLUMP OF WBCS FOR PATHOLOGIST REVIEW PATH
MICROBIOLOGY:
BODY FLUID CULTURE(Pleural Fluid)  8/29.   Gram Stain: Moderate WBCs present;   No organisms present   Culture: NO GROWTH 2 DAYS  [Final]
DVT Prophylaxis:Heparin
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Assessment: Patient with progression of metastatic colon cancer with mets to liver, spine and new pulmonary nodules, w/ R pleural effusion s/p placement of chest tube. 
1.  Pain Management: Pain control reportedly improved on 5-10mg Q3H of oxycodone. Patient appears comfortable, abdomen is nontender, states pain is well controlled but when asked to quantify it states that it is 6/10. Uncertain if the pain is from inflammation and capsular stretch secondary to progression of liver mets or irritation from ascites.   
-cont. oxycodone to 5-10mg Q3H PRN, monitor closely for sedation
-consider long acting agents in the future if patient continues to require frequent prn doses 
-steroids are a viable option for further pain control in patient's with metastatic liver disease, but does not appear necessary at this time. 
2. Delirium: very mild. Patient with some difficulty repeating complex phrases
and following more complex commands. 
-consider Haldol .5mg TID
3.  Code Status:  Code status changed to DNR/DNI during hospitalization. 
4.  Palliative care:  The husband feels the wife retains hope of significant improvement despite the odds, and would lose hope and just give up entirely if given a pessimisstic view of her disease.  He states that he his friend and mother both lost hope which expedited their deaths after they were made aware of prognosis. We discussed this with the patient's husband yesterday. Husband feels that home hospice is the best option at this point and would like to take her to Ohio for this, when patient able to be discharged. He still wishes to keep the details of her disease and prognosis from her. This issu may have to be readdressed in the near future.  
-continue plans for home hospice in the coming days

TEACHING PHYSICIAN ATTESTATION: GC; I saw and evaluated the patient. I agree with the findings and the plan of care as documented in the resident's note; I saw the patient on: **DATE[Nov 01 2009]; With the addition of: pt states that she is comfortable and then states that she wants medication for pain; cannot describe it and indicates lower to mid abdomen.   She has not questions about her health, as such we did not discuss.  It does not appear that her pain is currently from hepatic capsular distension, so would not give steroids.  Unclear if all of her opiate use is for physical pain or may also be clouded by delirium
