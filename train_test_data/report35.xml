Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is an **AGE[in 80s]-year-old woman who has a hypertension, atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation, history of pneumonia, hyperthyroidism, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, history of diarrhea.  She was recently here at **INSTITUTION for those problems.  She now returns with increasing dyspnea.  She denies any chest pain, chest discomfort.  She has a history of diabetes in addition to the above.  Because of her increasing shortness of breath, she was admitted here.  Presently, she is awake and alert.  Blood pressure is 158/62, saturations 94%, respiratory rate is 18, rate 68.  HEENT unremarkable.  Chest with diminished breath sounds, right greater than left.  Moderate JVD.  There is a 3+ left lift.  Carotids are brisk.  Auscultation:  S1 and S2, A2 is less than P2.  Abdomen is soft, cholecystectomy scar.  There is no edema.  Blood pressures are elevated.  K is only 3.6.  BNP is 518.  Chest x-ray has 3+ cardiomegaly, congestive heart failure, bilateral pleural effusion, LVH 50%.  EKG:  Atrial fibrillation, left anterior hemiblock, poor R wave progression.  Presently, I suspect this is diastolic dysfunction with pulmonary hypertension.  Presently, we are going to concentrate on getting her blood pressure under control using diuresis.  Her effusions are small and I do not think they need to be intervened with.  We will also correct her potassium.  Hopefully, diuresis will take care of this problem.
Thank you very much.
