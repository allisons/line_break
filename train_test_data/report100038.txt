ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Assessment: **AGE[in 50s] y/o gentleman with PMHx of COPD, DM, CAD, and Cirrhosis, who presents with intractable left sided HA and left facial pain. Found to have squamous cell carcinoma of left sinus.
- - - - -
Problem/Diagnosis 1: Left sided facial pain; Plan: Pain is result of squamous cell CA, and bony erosion. ENT debulking surgery should help with the pain. Also, the steriods will help a great deal, and decrease his opioid pain requirement. Several recs:
-Change Dilaudid PCA to 0.6 continous, with 0.4mg bolus every 15min, and **NAME[VVV] RN bolus to 1mg Q30min, no 1 hr limit.
-Start Deacdron 4mg BID, at 8am and noon, with one dose tonight.
-keep Neurontin at 300mg TID
Problem/Diagnosis 2: Anxiety/Depression; Plan: Uncertain if patient has a hx of Anixety or Depression. Pt denies any such history, but pt was on Buspar, Diazepam, and gabapentin on admission. Pt also in severe pain, and difficult to obtain full history. Would recommend:
-Changing buspar to 10mg TID
-**NAME[VVV] benzo to Ativan 1mg Q4hrs PO PRN

Please notify me if you would like me to follow the patient.  My advice regarding the following patient is listed above: **NAME[AAA, BBB]

TEACHING PHYSICIAN ATTESTATION: GC; I saw and evaluated the patient. I agree with the findings and the plan of care as documented in the resident's note; With the addition of: I reviewed the CT scans with the resident. The patient is a difficult historian given his pain and underlying psychiatric issues that I was unable to probe on this first visit. I do think that aggressive pain management would increase our ability to get a better understanding of this patient's psychiatric illness and improve coping with this devastating illness and what is going to be a very difficult road in the future. I saw the patient on: **DATE[Nov 05 2009]
