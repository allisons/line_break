Family/PCP Discussions1:  Date: **DATE[Nov 04 2009];  Resident: **NAME[TTT] with pt, two daughters, PNCC, attending physician and palliative care SW.  Discussed pt's continued lack of PO intake, persistent delirium and anemia. Given these findings and poor functional status, prognosis likely days-weeks.  Pt's priorities are being home and symptom control.  Suggested DC home with palliative home care for sx mgmt and continuation of IV nafcillin.  Suggested that at some point, dialysis may become a burden to patient.  Daughter, Robin, notes she is not ready for her mom to stop dialysis.  We discussed the posibility of transitioning to hospice should the pt and her family decide to stop dialysis.  Family agreed that goal is comfort and do not plan on re-admitting pt to the hospital.  We will plan on DC to home Sunday afternoon with Family Hospice and Palliative care providing home palliative care.
