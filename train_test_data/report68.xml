CONSULTING PHYSICIAN:  **NAME[WWW M. XXX], M.D.
DATE OF ADMISSION:  **DATE[Jun 21 2006]
DATE OF CONSULTATION:  **DATE[Jun 22 06]  
We were asked to see Mr. **NAME[AAA] on **DATE[Jun 22 2006] for pain management and goals.  He is a **AGE[in 50s]-year-old man with non-small cell lung cancer with brain mets and local extension.  He was admitted for left arm pain.  He presented initially in **DATE[Jun] of 2002 with locally advanced lung cancer and a solitary brain met was noted.  He had whole brain radiation, chemo and radiation therapy to the lung mass.  He has lost weight and he has been treated with additional chemotherapy until **DATE[Apr 2006].  He had Gamma knife on **DATE[Jun 08 2006].  He has chronic pain in his left shoulder and left arm secondary to brachial plexus radionecrosis and he was on OxyContin up to 30 mg p.o. b.i.d. and p.r.n. oxycodone.  At his last visit at **INSTITUTION on **DATE[Apr 22 2006], there was concern about his possibly using more pain medication than was prescribed and the decision was made not to use any long-acting opioids.
He was admitted with a two- to three-day history of chest pain that was ruled out for a cardiac etiology.  A CT scan showed interval progression of the left lung mass. 
The patient says he is getting weaker.  He lives with his **AGE[in 80s]-year-old mother and there has been concern expressed about his ability to do well at home. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Steroid-induced hyperglycemia.
2. Non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed in 2003
 
SOCIAL HISTORY: 
He is a smoker, does not use alcohol.  He lives in Verona with his **AGE[in 80s]-year-old mother.  He worked as a caseworker in the Salvation Army.  He smoked 30-pack year history.  
FAMILY HISTORY:
His father died of lung cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL APPEARANCE:  On examination, he is alert and oriented.  His mental status is normal.  He is not delirious.
VITAL SIGNS:  He is afebrile.  
HEENT:  His sclerae are nonicteric. 
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm with no murmur.
LUNGS:  Abnormalities at the left apex; otherwise, they are clear. 
ABDOMEN:  Soft. 
NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves are intact.  
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
He is a **AGE[in 50s]-year-old gentleman with metastatic non-small cell carcinoma of the lungs status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  He is status post a left craniotomy and he is currently on Tarceva.  He has an appointment in **DATE[Jul] with Dr. **NAME[VVV] at **NAME[UUU].  He has recently had Gamma knife on **DATE[Jun 08 2006].  
 
1. PAIN.  He thinks his pain is well controlled on opioids.  He has been using oxycodone 10 mg every four hours at home with two to three doses per day on average.  He thinks his pain is well controlled.  He describes his pain as in his left shoulder, but also in a radiating manner, but not classically neuropathic.  My recommendations are to send him home on oxycodone 10 mg every four hours as needed and also Neurontin 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.  We would like him to follow up at the outpatient Palliative Care Pain Service at **NAME[UUU] with **NAME[TTT SSS], the nurse coordinator, to start with  **PHONE) and I have given him a card.
2. NEUROPATHIC PAIN.  As stated above, I would add Neurontin to his opioids.
3. Physical Therapy has said he can go home.  He understands that he may need additional care.  He will stay in touch with Palliative Care.  For now, he is able to function at home. 
4. GOALS:  He says he grew up Catholic.  He is not ready to see a priest.  He says he has thought about death and he understands he will die of lung cancer most likely.  He does not want to be intubated or resuscitated should his heart stop or he require intubation because of lung cancer.  At that point, he would like to be comfortable and he would like to die at home, which would be his preference.  
 
This consult took 80 minutes, greater than half of the visit's coordinating care and talking with the patient face-to-face.
