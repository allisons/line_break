ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
- - - - -
Problem/Diagnosis 1: Pain;  Assessment/Plans: believes ultram is helpful.  Continue ATC dosing.  Judge pain regimen efficacy by increased function (hard when he is nonambulatory or subjective report of pain
Problem/Diagnosis 2: Depression;  Assessment/Plans: no changes
Problem/Diagnosis 3: Constipation;  Assessment/Plans: if no bm today, would increase senna to bid.  May improve since off opioids.  But diuretics can also conribute to
Problem/Diagnosis 4: Goals
Problem/Diagnosis 5: sedation;  Assessment/Plans: see if improves off of tylenol with codeine.  Pt stated he did find it helpful
Problem/Diagnosis 6: insomnia;  Assessment/Plans: would continue to evaluate, may have been helped by need not to get up and urinate.  if this is the case, may need more evaluation/med adjustment for home
