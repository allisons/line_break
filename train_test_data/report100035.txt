ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Assessment: patient with ESLD, not a transplant candidate, s/p failed OTL, s/p nephrectomy for RCC and right upper lobe lobectomy for Lung cancer
- - - - -
Problem/Diagnosis 1: Abdominal pain; Plan: Improved after paracentesis, now on PO Dilaudid PRN which was effective when given. Currently pain free.
Predominant symptom is fatigue
Problem/Diagnosis 2: nausea; Plan: None at present.
Problem/Diagnosis 3: Disposition ; Plan: More NH options are now available given that the Prograf has been discontinued. Patient's profound fatigue, continued hypotension, and multisystem organ failure without antibiotics and antirejection therapy also make him a candidate for inpatient hospice care at a hospice facility. I conveyed my recommendations to the palliative care SW **NAME[VVV UUU] who is going to explore that option with the family. If they are agreeable, we can proceed with plans for that. Will d/w primary team as well.
