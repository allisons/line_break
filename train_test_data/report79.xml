CONSULTING PHYSICIAN:  **NAME[YYY M ZZZ]
DATE OF ADMISSION:  **DATE[Jul 12 2006]
DATE OF CONSULTATION:  **DATE[Jul 13 06]  
We were asked by Dr. **NAME[YYY ZZZ] to see the patient in consultation.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Pain and goals of care.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a **AGE[in 60s]-year-old male with a history of unresectable pancreatic cancer first diagnosed in **DATE[May] of last year status post palliative resection.  He had a complicated hospital course after his initial palliative resection, but had been transferred to a nursing home and was living there. He was readmitted on **DATE[Jul 12] with acute renal failure, hypernatremia and leukocytosis, and he was complaining of intractable nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.  He appeared dehydrated.  He had been fed with J-tube feedings.  He was admitted for IV fluids, antibiotics, and pain control.  He also was found to have a likely biloma around the site of his percutaneous biliary drain.
The resident on our service talked to the patient about goals of care and he did not want artificial measures to prolong his life.  He was amenable to non-invasive measures such as antibiotics and blood transfusions.  He does not want dialysis and does not want to be resuscitated or on the ventilator.
 He identified his sister, **NAME[TTT SSS],  **PHONE) as his decision maker.
 He understands that his tumor is unresectable but is still wondering if there is some sort of treatment he could have.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Pancreatic cancer diagnosed in **DATE[May] of 2006 as mentioned above.  He is status post PTC placement and status post palliative resection of his tumor and also status post left hepatic artery coiling and gastrojejunostomy.  
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient has been residing at a nursing home.  He is married and not religious.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
The patient reported that IV Dilaudid takes his pain from a 9 down to a 4 but was complaining of no pain when we saw him.  At this time, he said his nausea and vomiting were improved with the Zofran and IV hydration.  The remainder of his review of systems is negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On examination, the patient is thin, pale, sleeping but easily arousable and in no apparent distress.  
HEENT EXAMINATION:  Anicteric sclerae.  Moist mucous membranes.
CARDIOVASCULAR:   Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Right-sided tenderness at the site of the J-tube, normal bowel sounds.
SKIN:  No rash.
NEUROLOGIC:  No myoclonus or seizures are noted.
PSYCHIATRIC:  Alert and oriented times three.  CAM negative.
LABORATORY DATA:
BUN 83, creatinine 1.8, white count 16.9, lipase 646.
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
1. Goals of care.  The patient is now DNR/DNI and we placed the code sheet in the chart.  We will continue to talk with him and find out whether or not he is seeing Medical-Oncology for any sort of palliative chemotherapy.
2. Pain.  The pain is intermittent and likely secondary to his pancreatitis and biloma.  I would recommend continuing the p.r.n. IV Dilaudid but change the dosing interval to two hours.  
3. Nausea.  Continuer Zofran.
We will continue to follow.
