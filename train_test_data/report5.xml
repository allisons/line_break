She has been feeling too ill to take her Lasix. Denies any chest pain or palpitations.  In the hospital she was found to have mild congestive heart failure, low grade temperature and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  She currently is somewhat tachypneic.

4. Lasix

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS 
Positive for shortness of breath and lower extremity edema.  No palpitations. 
 Positive low grade temperature.  No claudication.  No headache.  No dysuria. 
 The rest of the review of systems are negative.   
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
She is a pleasant woman in no acute distress. Blood pressure is 99/50, pulse is 122 and irregular, temperature is 99.7. Eyes are anicteric.  Oral mucosa is moist.  Neck is supple with 2+ carotids without bruits.  Lungs show decreased breath sounds and prolonged expiratory phase.  Minimal rales.  Heart is irregularly irregular. S1 and S2.  No S3 or S4. No significant murmurs or rubs.  No gallops. Abdomen is soft, non-tender and non-distended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Positive bowel sounds.  Extremities show no cyanosis or clubbing, mild edema.  
 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm with non-specific ST segment abnormalities. She has atrial fibrillation that presumably started at 3:30 AM.  She had an echocardiogram done on 5/06 that showed normal left ventricular function.   
 
LABORATORY DATA 
Currently show BUN and creatinine of 27 and .9.  Troponin .04. White count of 1.6.  Hemoglobin 9.4. Platelet count of 115,000. INR pending this morning and INR yesterday is 1.9.   Chest x-ray shows some mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 
ASSESSMENT:
The patient is an **AGE[in 80s] year old woman with multiple medical problems presenting with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with shortness of breath that may be multifactorial including congestive heart failure as well as underlying infectious process in the setting of chemo with a cough and wheezing.  
 
She has diuresed well over night.  She is back in atrial fibrillation.  If her INR is less than 2.0 today will place her on intravenous heparin. Would increase her Cardizem bolus for rate control. 
 
 
If she is difficult to control given her blood pressure and heart rate may consider adding Amiodarone.  An echocardiogram has been ordered and pending.  
 
 
Dr **NAME[UUU] will treat her for a pulmonary process.  
 
Thank you very much.
