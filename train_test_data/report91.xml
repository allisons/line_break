REASON FOR CONSULTATION:  Recurrent malignant pleural effusion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an **AGE[in 80s]-year-old female with a known diagnosis of metastatic breast CA with a left-sided pleural effusion and a left lung mass.  She previously had thoracentesis done with drainage of 4.5 L of fluid.  She was recently readmitted about 3 days ago from Dr. **NAME[ZZZ]'s office for increasing shortness of breath.  A chest CT showed loculated pleural effusion.  A pigtail catheter was placed by Pulmonary service.  The pigtail catheter was accidentally discontinued today and I was called in consultation for further management of recurrent pleural effusion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for

1.  Hypertension.
2.  Metastatic breast cancer.
3.  Anxiety.
4.  SVT.
5.  Congestive heart failure.
6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

MEDICATIONS:  She is on

1.  Aspirin.
2.  Nexium.
3.  Lasix.
4.  Lopressor.
5.  Prednisone.
6.  Potassium.
7.  Xanax.

ALLERGIES:  She denies any drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She denies any history of smoking or alcohol.  She lives with her caregiver at home.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is positive for cancer in grandmother.  One of the sisters had breast cancer.  No history of cancer in the parents.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  An 11-point review of systems is negative except mentioned in history and physical.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A pleasant, elderly, fragile lady, who is not in any acute distress.  Her vitals are stable.  Head is atraumatic and normocephalic.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Extraocular movements are intact.  No cervical lymphadenopathy.  No neck masses.  Normal posterior pharyngeal mucosa.  Chest: Decreased air entry on the left side.  Abdomen is soft, nondistended, and nontender.  Extremities: No clubbing, no cyanosis, no edema.  She has restriction of range of motion in the knee joint.  Neuro grossly intact.  No focal neurological deficit.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  An elderly female with recurrent left-sided pleural effusion status post thoracentesis in the past and recent pigtail insertion.  
The patient symptomatically better.  I will recommend for her to have a repeat CT scan to evaluate the extent of the fluid collection and if it is loculated or not, and the recommendation will depend on the results of the CT scan.  I will continue to follow her.

I appreciate the consult.
