HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Intracerebral hemorrhage.
I evaluated this patient with the resident physician, Dr.   **NAME[OOO NNN].  We discussed the history, physical and plan.  I concur with his findings.

The patient is an intubated sedated, **AGE[in 70s]-year-old man who comes from an outside facility with the diagnosis of right intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the basal ganglia thalamus region.  The patient was intubated and could not give any other history, but prior to being intubated did give the history of weakness on the left side, as well as around 5 o'clock this evening, he was feeding the dogs, fell having a syncopal episode and rolled down a hill to the neighbor for help.  The patient at that time did have left arm and left leg weakness and at the outside facility was diagnosed with an intracerebral hemorrhage.  Because of progressive symptoms and lethargy along with decreased gag reflex, the patient was intubated and brought here for evaluation.  The patient did have blood pressure control prior to arrival with Dilantin and was given some Mannitol and presents here for evaluation.
