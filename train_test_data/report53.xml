CHIEF COMPLAINT:  
 
We are asked to see **NAME[BBB AAA], a **AGE[in 40s]-year-old Caucasian gentleman by the primary service for evaluation of acute hepatitis with jaundice.  I personally interviewed and examined the patient.  I agree with the history and physical and plan as outlined by the pathology fellow.  Please link this note to his.   
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
 
Briefly, Mr. **NAME[AAA] was admitted with a one-week history of increasing fatigue, dark urine, pale stool and minimal pruritus.  The blood work was checked and revealed an elevated total bilirubin and also a markedly elevated transaminase in the 2000 range.  Interestingly, the patient states that back in **DATE[Jan] of 2006 he had a similar episode where he developed jaundice which resolved spontaneously.  There is no documentation of this and he did not go for medical care at this time so no blood work was drawn.   
 
The patient denies any fever, chills or real abdominal pain.  He has had some mild anorexia but this has improved.  He has not lost weight.  He has not noticed any diarrhea or blood in the stool.   
 
The patient does have significant risk factors for viral hepatitis.  He was using intranasal cocaine up until two weeks ago and also is sexually active and his girlfriend has a history of hepatitis C.   
 
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:  
 
His past medical history is significant for beta thalassemia and he has had some minor knee surgery.  He had some reflux symptoms.  He denies any diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension or abdominal surgeries.   
 
MEDICATIONS:  
 
Medications at home:  He was on no prescribed medication.  He denied any Tylenol; herbal medication or supplements.   
 
ALLERGIES:
 
DENIED.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  
 
He is single with a girlfriend.  He denies any significant alcohol use and has never been a heavy drinker.  He does have a history of intranasal cocaine use but denies any intravenous drug use.  He has had no tattoos.   
 
FAMILY HISTORY:  
 
There is no family history of liver disease.  
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
 
The review of systems is as above.  He denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills, headache, or dysuria.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
 
On examination, he looked well.  Vital signs:  The blood pressure is 105/70; pulse 86 beats per minute and regular.  He was afebrile.  There was no liver flap or palmar erythema.   
 
HEENT examination revealed scleral icterus.
 
There were three or four spider nevi.
 
Cardiovascular system revealed normal S1 and S2 with added sounds.  
 
Chest revealed clear lung fields. 
 
Abdominal examination revealed a soft, nontender abdomen without splenomegaly but with the liver edge felt some 5 cm below the right costal margin; it was smooth.  There was no ascites and the bowel sounds are heard.   
 
Extremities revealed no edema.  
 
The skin revealed jaundice. 
 
Neurologically, he was alert and oriented times three.  
 
LABORATORY RESULTS:  
 
His Tylenol level was negative.  Hemoglobin was 10.1, MCV 68.1 which is his baseline.  He had normal renal function and normal electrolytes.  Total bilirubin was 9.8.  ALT was 2276, AST 1098, alkaline phosphatase 200, GGT 
496, INR 1.1.   
 
The CT scan by report shows no evidence of cirrhosis or portal hypertension.  
Right upper quadrant ultrasound is pending from today.   
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
 
In summary, this is a **AGE[in 40s]-year-old Caucasian gentleman with a history of acute hepatitis seen for evaluation.   
 
Differential diagnosis here rests between a viral infection versus autoimmune disease versus the possibility of metabolic disease.  I doubt very much this is obstruction given the level of transaminases.  This is less likely to be a toxic hepatitis as he really has no history of ingestion of any substance such as Tylenol.   
 
Blood work has been sent but if his liver enzymes improve then he can be discharged to be followed up in the **INSTITUTION in a week or two.  
Conversely, if his liver enzymes worsen, then I would proceed with a liver biopsy.   
 
 
Thank you again for this kind consultation.  We will follow in the hospital.
