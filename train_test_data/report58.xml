REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
Abdominal distention, left lower quadrant pain, nausea.  
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a **AGE[90+]-year-old female who is not a very good historian but says that she lives alone has been admitted through the Emergency Department with complaints of what she describes as one week of abdominal pain mostly in the lower abdomen with abdominal distention, nausea.  She denies vomiting although there is a record of the patient having emesis in the chart.  She denies any hematochezia, hematemesis, melena, weight loss, dysphagia, or odynophagia.  She does say that she has been constipated.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was done on **DATE[May 15 2007] which shows diverticulosis and a dilated endometrial canal, endometrial carcinoma should be excluded.  Pelvic ultrasound has been recommended.  Gynecologic consultation has been requested.  There is no CT evidence of diverticulitis.

91.3, platelets 196.  CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis as above.  UA - 
Negative bilirubin, trace blood.   
CLINICAL IMPRESSION:
This is a **AGE[90+]-year-old female being admitted with lower abdominal pain, mild left lower quadrant tenderness, abnormal CT scan of the uterus.  We need to exclude uterine carcinoma, and I would suggest that we await the gynecologic consultation.  She has never had an endoscopy or colonoscopy.  At this time she is denying any upper GI symptoms.  I would suggest that after the gynecologic evaluation is done and depending on these findings, she may require further GI evaluation.  We need to exclude in addition to this diverticulosis causing the constipation, and I would also start her on lactulose for the constipation.  If she has any nausea or vomiting she may require an EGD.  I will keep her on PPI therapy for now with appropriate prescription placed in the chart.
