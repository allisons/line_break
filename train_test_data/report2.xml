**INSTITUTION 
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT
PATIENT NAME:  **NAME[AAA, BBB M]
ACCOUNT #:  **ID-NUM
DATE OF SERVICE:  **DATE[Feb 02 06]
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: A  N
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Arm laceration.
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 50s]-year-old male who was leaning against the hutch in his house last evening, when he noticed the glass broke.  It did not shatter.  It stayed in one large piece.  It lacerated his right arm.  He cleaned and dressed it.  He used local cleansing combined with hydrogen peroxide and then applied Neosporin and a bandage.  He came here this evening, as his wife continued to "pester" him to come to be evaluated.  His last tetanus was six years ago.   
He has had no fevers or chills, no distal paresthesia, and no loss of consciousness.   
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:    
Review of systems are outlined above or in the resident note.  Remainder are negative.   
Past medical history, medications, allergies, social history, and family history outlined in the resident's note.   
PHYSICAL EXAM:  
VITAL SIGNS:  Afebrile 36.4, heart rate 80, respiratory rate 16, BP 138/82, and satting 94% on room air.   
GENERAL:  He is conscious, alert, and oriented to person, place, time, and events preceding.   
RIGHT FOREARM:  Right forearm shows a laceration in an L formation, approximately 1 cm horizontally by 2 cm vertically at the lateral aspect of the arm.  He is neurovascularly intact distal to this and it already has begun to heal.  There is no erythema, pus or induration in the surrounding areas.  Neurovascularly intact and also has normal tendon function without pain, pus, or active bleeding.  I cannot palpate any subcutaneous air or any signs of retained foreign body.   
ED COURSE:  
Given this, I believe the patient is now outside a good window for repair with sutures, and I believe the incidence of infection will be increased should we try to reopen this and thereafter suture close it.  It appears to be approximated well and it is healing well without active bleeding or sign of infection, and, therefore, I have recommended he continue the Neosporin at home.  We will update his tetanus shot and advised him to keep this clean and dry and to follow up with his primary care physician in one week for reevaluation.  He is given signs and symptoms for followup.  He voiced understanding and agreement with the plan and left the Emergency Department under his own power.   
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS(ES):  
RIGHT FOREARM LACERATION.
