**INSTITUTION
Consultation
Name: **NAME[AAA, BBB]
Acct #: **ID-NUM
MRN: **ID-NUM
Admitted: **DATE[Aug 02 2007]
Date: **DATE[Aug 02 2006]
Dict: **NAME[ZZZ, YYY]
Attend: **NAME[ZZZ, YYY]
The patient is an **AGE[in 80s]-year-old white female known to me, status post TAH-BSO, cholecystectomy, appendectomy in the past, also with a history of coronary artery disease status post PTCA with stent in 2004, hypertension, diverticulitis, hyperlipidemia, and multiple chronic abdominal complaints.  
She just returned from a visit to her daughter in New York on Thursday, and shortly afterwards had the onset of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  She says that for the last several weeks, she has had fluctuating abdominal pain with left mid and left upper quadrant abdominal pain.  She has had some vague chest discomfort and nausea and vomiting, followed by diarrhea.  The diarrhea is black, but she admits to taking Pepto-Bismol.  Her vomit is non-bloody.  
She says that in the last several weeks, she has had some vague abdominal pain and went to her doctor in New York, and had a CT scan of the abdomen which was negative.  She has had some bright red blood with wiping, but basically, her abdomen was pretty good in New York.  She had a colonoscopy in 2004, which was an incomplete examination secondary to stool.  At that time, she had diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, and a tubular adenoma.  She also had an endoscopy in 2004, which showed a hiatal hernia and hyperplastic fundal polyps.  
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As above.  
ALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN, SULFA, AND STATINS.  
SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke or drink.  
MEDICATIONS:  
1.  Lopressor.  
2.  Plavix.  
3.  Imdur.  
4.  81 mg of aspirin.  
5.  Digoxin.  
6.  Norvasc.  
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is an alert female.  Blood pressure 148/92.  Rate regular at 76.  Lungs clear.  Core normal S1 and S2.  Abdomen is soft, diffuse discomfort, but very variable.  Rectal was heme-positive by house staff and labs.  
LABORATORY DATA:  H&amp;H 14.3/41.9, WBCs 6,900, platelets 286,000, MCV 87.6.  
LFTs normal.  INR 1.1, sodium 141, potassium 4.0, chloride 104, CO2 24,  BUN 
14, creatinine 0.7, glucose 101.  EKG:  Old lateral MI.  
IMPRESSION:  Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, most likely gastroenteritis.  I doubt if we are dealing with ischemic colitis or ulcerative disease.  
Diverticulitis is possible, but again, the nausea and vomiting would not be consistent with this.  Her pattern of illness is similar to the past in that when she returns from New York and is alone in **PLACE, she begins to have multiple abdominal complaints.  This is a little unusual with the nausea and vomiting and the diarrhea.  At this time, we will just check her stool cultures and C. diff.  I would also check a urine culture because of the urinary complaints, and see how she does.  She is heme-positive.  This could be just irritation from the diarrhea.  If her H&amp;H is stable, then probably no further workup will be done while she is in the hospital.  Her dark stool is probably from the Pepto-Bismol.  At this time, we will just monitor her stools.  If she remains heme-positive, then possibly as an outpatient, we will repeat a colonoscopy, but again, based on her previous history and multiple complaints in the past, I doubt if we are dealing with significant GI pathology.  She would like to see her cardiologist, Dr. **NAME[XXX], while she is here, and we will consult him to take a look.
