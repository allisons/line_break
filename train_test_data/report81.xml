This is Dr. **NAME[VVV WWW] dictating a procedure note for this inpatient. 
 
PROCEDURE:  ENDOSCOPIC RETROGRADE CHOLANGIOPANCREATOGRAPHY WITH STENT EXCHANGE.
 
BRIEF HISTORY:  A **AGE[in 20s]-year-old man status post gunshot and right liver lobectomy with persistent bile leak from his JP drainages. 
 
PROCEDURISTS:  **NAME[VVV M. WWW], M.D. and **NAME[SSS M. RRR], M.D.
 
ANESTHESIA:  General intubation.
 
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After explaining the risk, benefits, alternatives, and complications of the procedure, he signed his informed consent.  The patient was placed on the fluoroscopic table in supine position.  Endotracheal intubation  was performed.  During the whole procedure, the patient's vitals were  continuously monitored.  The therapeutic Pentax duodenoscope was advanced from the patient's mouth to the second portion of the duodenum.  Gross inspection of the esophagus and stomach appeared normal. 
 
There was a plastic stent protruding from the papilla.  The stent appeared occluded.  With the help of an occlusion balloon, a guidewire was advanced through the stent in the intrahepatics.  The stent was subsequently removed over the wire with a use of a snare.  Occlusion cholangiogram revealed normal caliber common bile duct and left intrahepatics and bile leak at the right lobectomy site.  At this point, sweeping of the duct with the balloon revealed no evidence of sludge or stones.  A new 10-French x 7-cm plastic biliary stent was then deployed at good position with the use of the OASIS system.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, and the stent was deployed in good position. 
 
The scope was withdrawn to the stomach and all the gastric secretions were suctioned. 
 
IMPRESSION:  Right lobectomy site leak status post biliary stent exchange.
 
PLAN:
1. The patient is to return to the floor.
2. Continue to follow the JP drainage.
3. Per primary surgical team.
 
ATTESTATION STATEMENT:  I attest that I was present during the entire portion of the procedure as well as during the acquisition and interpretation of the fluoroscopic images.
