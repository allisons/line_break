ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  **NAME[QQQ M PPP]
ADMISSION DATE:  **DATE[Apr 26 2007]
EVALUATION DATE:  **DATE[May 05 06]
I personally managed Mr. **NAME[AAA] in the ICU, an **AGE[in 80s]-year-old man with a history of right-sided intracranial bleed, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, on multiple medications, left lower lobe infiltrate compatible with pneumonia on Unasyn, now reintubated for respiratory failure and requiring substantial pulmonary toilette and mechanical ventilation.  His oxygen saturation is good on mechanical ventilation.  Blood pressure 141/73 with a heart rate of 98.  His laboratory parameters are otherwise unremarkable.  His major problem now continues to be persistent respiratory  insufficiency leading to respiratory failure and intubation.   We will have a discussion with the family today to decide if they choose to have him get a tracheostomy.  If that is the case, he will more than likely require custodial care in a skilled nursing facility. 
Critical care time:  30 minutes.
