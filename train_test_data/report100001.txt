ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Assessment: **AGE[in 70s] yo female w/ a h/o ESRD s/p failed kidney transplant, CAD s/p CABG/AVR on coumadin, admitted with bleeding AV fistula with hospital course c/b SAH, small bowel volvulus, GI bleed, and STEMI, now w/ continuing abdominal pain and decreased PO intake.
1. Pain: 
a) Abdominal Pain: Unclear etiology for pain - possibly secondary to recent surgery or mesenteric ischemia, as it appears to be exacerbated signficantly by PO intake. Recent CT shows no recurrence of volvulus or other obvious etiology for pain. Would continue conservative management and attempt to control patient's pain with opiates.
b) Hip Pain: Recently had hip replacement. Has pain since then. Says that pain has aggravated though. Given history of bacteremia, there is chance of seeding, however, cultures have been negative for some time so it not very likely.
c) Back Pain: Chronic. Similar in intesity as she experiences at home.
--Patient was initially started on Hydromorphone PCA, but was not using it appropraitely. Therefore was switched to short acting oral hydromorphone for pain, to which she seems to have responded. Upon repeated evaluation in afternoon patient was in considerably less pain. Continue same dose.
-- Will continue same dose of Fentanyl patch. Will adjust dose depending on requirement in next 24 hours.
-- Continue amitriptyline.
2. She also appears to have a mild hypoactive delirium, possibly secondary to her acute illness/hospitalization/pain.
-- Was given 0.5mg Haldol Q8hrs. Reduced **DATE[Oct 31 2009]  to 0.5mg Q12hrs.
-- Mental status has significantly improved. As per daughters this has been the best in weeks.
3. Goals of Care: Met with patient's two daughters today , including **NAME[VVV] who has been the primary spokesperson. Goals of care were discussed.
-- Patient wants to focus on two things: Pain control and staying at home.
-- Does not want artificial support, and wants to be DNR/DNI. Does not want feeding tube.
-- Prefers symptomatic relief and staying with family over life prolongation.
-- Both patient and family does not want the patient to go to a nursing home. 
-- Family meeting on **DATE[Nov 2 2009] (AM) where goals will be discussed further, home care and facility care (including TCU) options will be discussed. Palliative care options at home will be explored.
-- Discussed home care options will social worker and we will discuss them with family on **DATE[Nov 02 2009]. Findings and plan was discussed with Dr. **NAME[XXX]. We will continue to follow the patient.
