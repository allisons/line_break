 Her iron is probably exacerbating this.  She is not responding to Zofran.  We will discontinue Zofran, hold her iron tablets, and start Haldol 0.5 q.12 and 0.5 as a p.r.n.
Problem #2:  Coping and compliance.  The patient has been agreeable to see our behavior medicine psychologist and she will see her on Monday.
