PALLIATIVE CARE INITIAL CONSULTATION NOTE: 
 
REASON FOR CONSULTATION: I was asked to see the patient by Dr. **NAME[VVV] to assist with symptom control and end-of-life care. 
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old man admitted on **DATE[Oct 28] after a cardiac arrest. He underwent a cardiac catheterization and was found to have a left circumflex occlusion and bare-metal stents were placed which were complicated by dissection of the left circumflex without tamponade physiology. He was cooled with the cooling protocol; however, his mental status is not improving. He has been followed by both Neurology and the Post-Arrest Team. He has also been seen by Medical Ethics since he has a clear Living Will that indicates a desire for no aggressive measures. We are consulted to help with goals of care, end-of-life planning and symptom control. The patient is unresponsive, but generally appears comfortable. He is unable to provide further history.

1. Unasyn. 
2. Aspirin.

ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. 
 
SOCIAL HISTORY: Positive tobacco, rare alcohol and no drugs; lived with wife. 
 
FAMILY HISTORY: Coronary artery disease. 
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Unable to complete secondary to altered mental status. 
 
EDMONTON SYMPTOM ASSESSMENT SCALE: Unable to complete secondary to altered mental status. 
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
 
VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 36.0, blood pressure 115/48, pulse 67, respirations 24 and saturation 94% on 15 liters nonrebreather. 
 
IN GENERAL: The patient is in no apparent distress; generally appears comfortable. 
 
HEAD AND NECK EXAMINATION: Oropharynx is clear. Mucous membranes are moist. Pupils are reactive. 
 
RESPIRATORY EXAMINATION: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. 
 
CARDIOVASCULAR EXAMINATION: Regular rate and rhythm. 
 
ABDOMINAL EXAMINATION: Positive bowel sounds, nontender and nondistended. 
 
EXTREMITIES: Trace edema. 
 
NEURO: Unresponsive. 
 
SKIN: No rash. 
 
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratories are notable for a creatinine of 0.8, normal LFTs, albumin of 2.2, white blood cells 5, hemoglobin 10.2, platelets of 194 and INR of 1.3. 
 
Head CT from **DATE[Oct 27] is negative. Brain MRI from **DATE[Oct 31] shows punctate focus of true restricted diffusion in the right centrum semiovale consistent with recent infarct, chronic small vessel ischemic disease and possible left frontal intraosseous meningioma. EEG showed frequent interictal discharges, maximum in the midline and stimulus sensitive myoclonic seizures. 
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A **AGE[in 70s]-year-old man status post cardiac arrest. 
 
1. GOALS: The family is waiting to hear final input from the Post-Arrest Team. If recovery was thought to be unlikely, they want to convert to Comfort Measures Only and transfer to an inpatient hospice closer to home. This will make it easier for the wife to visit. I have paged the on-call social worker to find an inpatient unit near Cranberry Township so the family can visit it today. The primary team will discuss with the Post-Arrest Team and tell the family the final prognostic estimate, after which I anticipate they will want to switch to Comfort Measures Only and transfer to inpatient hospice closer to home. 
 
2. PAIN AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH: The patient has no current pain or shortness of breath. I would start with morphine 2 mg IV q. 15 minutes p.r.n. if changed to Comfort Measures Only. This could also be given subcutaneously if his IV is nonfunctioning. 
 
3. ANXIETY: I would use Ativan 1 mg IV or p.o. q. 30 minutes p.r.n. 
 
4. SEIZURE: I will discuss with Neurology converting to a regimen suitable for hospice. Given his lack of mental status, I would think the easiest would be a standing regimen of Ativan, such as Ativan 1 mg IV or p.o. q. 4 hours around-the-clock. 
 
5. Support provided to the family.
