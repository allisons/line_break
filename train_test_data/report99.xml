INDICATIONS:
**NAME[BBB AAA] is a **AGE[in 20s]-year-old female who has a severe injury to her right hand.  She has inability to flex her ring and the small fingers.  She has an extended posture of these fingers.  She has decreased sensation to these fingers as well.  She has a laceration that extends into the thenar eminence.  The patient understands the risks of bleeding, infection, and the need for revision surgery in the future.  She also understands the need to have this surgery performed.   
DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  
She was taken to the operating room after a long discussion.  She was given axillary anesthesia.  She was prepped and draped in the usual manner.  The limb was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was inflated.  The patient had a gash in her hand that was roughly 9 cm long.  This was oblique in nature and extended from a radial and distal origin to an ulnar and proximal location and this proximal location was just distal to the pisiform bone.  The patient had this incision copiously irrigated and dbrided.  The patient then had the proximal incision extended and this was extended into curvilinear manner, extending into the ulnar nerve proximally and the length of the proximal extension was roughly 5 cm and distally the patient had a longitudinal incision made towards the juncture between the ring and small finger distally.  Sharp incision was made through skin.  Blunt dissection was performed thereafter.  The patient proximally had the ulnar nerve visualized after thick skin flaps were created.  The ulnar nerve and the ulnar artery were dissected free and traced distally.  This allowed identification of the motor branch and the motor branch was fortunately spared for the most part.  
There was a partial disruption and evidence of contusion around the motor branch, but it did not appear to be significantly disrupted.   
The patient then had the digital nerve dissected free and the flexors tendons dissected free.  In order to identify any injury to the media nerve, I performed a carpal tunnel release as well.  This was made sharply through skin.  Blunt dissection was performed thereafter.  Click it retractors were placed distally and proximally within the wound.  Blunt dissection was performed through the palmar fascia and then the transverse carpal ligament was divided using sharp dissection method.  The confluence of the antebrachial fascia with the transverse carpal ligament was divided with tenotomies.  The patient's superficial arch was visualized and dissected from known territory distally within the carpal tunnel incision and all the way into the Guyon canal region.  This allowed excellent visualization of the superficial arch and very luckily for her the patient did not have disruption of the superficial arch.  The flexor tendons were cut however and both the FDP and FDF tendon were cut to the ring and small fingers.  These tendons were sequentially repaired with 2-0 Ethibond modified Tajima sutures and then a 5-0 nylon running stitch epi-tendinous in nature was used to bring the tendon ends together perfectly.  The patient had excellent repair for tendons accomplished and this restored the natural cascade to her ring and small fingers.  The attention was then focused on the digital nerve and these were already dissected free with high-powered magnification and then microsuture technique was used to repair the digital nerves that were injured.  Then three 8-0 nylon sutures were used for each nerve and excellent epineural approximation was accomplished.  Due to the lacerating mechanism and the fact that we were able to repair this in the acute setting, there was no retraction of these nerve ends and no debridement was necessary other than the debridement performed at the initial onset of surgery.  The patient's wound was then copiously irrigated and excellent excursion of the flexor tendons visualized.   
The patient then had the hypothenar intrinsic muscles repaired.  This was done with 2-0 Vicryl stitches placed within the fascia; three muscles were repaired, specifically, the abductor, digiti minimi, and the opponens digiti minimi, and small intrinsic flexor for the hypothenar mass.  Once these three muscles were repaired, excellent restoration of the hypothenar eminence was accomplished as well.  The patient, of note, had the tourniquet let down.  
The wound was copiously irrigated.  She had excellent perfusion noted to her small finger.  The cascade of her small and ring finger was restored due to the flexor tendon repair.  The incisions were closed with 4-0 nylon and the patient was placed in a splint, which kept the wrist in 10 degrees of extension.  The fingers were maintained free.  The patient tolerated this very well.
