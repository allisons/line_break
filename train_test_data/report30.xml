DIAGNOSIS:  Degenerative arthritis, right hip.
PROCEDURE:  Right minimally invasive total hip replacement under spinal anesthesia, image intensification.
ASSISTANT:  **NAME[XXX WWW], PA-C
HISTORY:  For several years this woman has experienced insidious onset and progression of pain in her right hip that became incapacitating despite conservative treatment.  Recent clinical and radiographic features were consistent with severe degenerative arthritis of the right hip.  Recommendation was made for right minimally invasive total hip replacement.  The risks, complications, and therapeutic options were reviewed.  The patient was agreeable to proceed.
TECHNIQUE:  The patient was draped and prepped in usual sterile fashion under spinal anesthesia.  She was placed supine with an inflatable pad elevated under her right hip.  With image intensification, the site for an oblique 5-cm incision anterior to the intertrochanteric ridge of the right proximal femur was identified.  The incision was extended sharply through the subcutaneous fat and deep fascia.  A few small subcutaneous bleeding points were clamped and cauterized.  Curved scissors was used to bluntly develop the interval between tensor and sartorius down to the underlying hip capsule.  
The traversing lateral circumflex vessels were identified, clamped, cauterized, and divided.  The hip capsule was incised with the electrocautery along the axis of the femoral neck with supplementary releases around the acetabular rim, and along the intertrochanteric ridge.  Hip retractors were placed deep to the capsule.  Observation confirmed features of severe degenerative arthritis of the femoral head with complete erosion of articular cartilage and osteophytes.  With image intensification, the site for a standard osteotomy of the proximal femur was identified.  The osteotomy was completed with a reciprocal saw, along with a parallel cut through the equator of the femoral head.  The neck fragment was impaled with a Schanz screw to extract it.  The head fragment was grasped with a bone clamp to remove it.  The labrum was sharply excised.  The acetabulum was debrided with curettes and rongeurs.  Periodically, profuse antibiotic irrigation with jet lavage was performed.  The acetabulum was reamed incrementally with hemispherical reamers through size 54 mm.  With imaging, a **NAME[VVV] trabecular metal shell of 54 mm was selected.  The shell was inserted into the acetabulum on the aligning tool and impacted.  Supplementary anchorage was achieved with 2 of the 6.5 mm cancellous screws inserted into 3.2-mm drill holes with the use of a depth gauge.  Solid fixation of the shell was documented.  A 10-degree anterior wall elevated polyethylene liner was impacted into the metal backing.  Attention was turned to the proximal femur. 

Initially, the contralateral left hip was hyperextended by adjustment of the Jupiter table.  The right lower extremity was placed in the figure-of-four position.  A box chisel was used on the osteotomized femoral neck.  A 1 cm square of capsule was sharply excised from the lateral aspect of the neck.  Curved scissors was used to incise the capsule above the neck.  Lines were drawn on the thigh to identify the site for the second 3-cm incision high in the lateral aspect of the hip.  The incision was extended sharply through the subcutaneous fat and deep fascia.  A few small subcutaneous bleeding points were clamped and cauterized.  Curved scissors were used to bluntly develop a tunnel through gluteus maximus into the hip joint.  The 3 sizers of hip dilator were used to enlarge the tunnel.  A pointed awl was used to impale the osteotomized femoral neck.  A ball-ended guidewire was passed down the femoral canal for flexible reaming incrementally through 14 mm.  The VerSys solid reamers and rasps were used incrementally through size 14.  The last was rotationally stable.  Imaging confirmed appropriate fit and fill and axial alignment.  The rasp was removed with pulsatile jet lavage.  A size 14 Epic stem was inserted into the second incision while viewed through the anterior incision.  It was fully impacted in place where it was stable.  Trial reduction was satisfactorily performed with a minus 3.5-mm neck and 32-mm head.  Equality of limb length and stability of the hip were confirmed. The hip was dislocated for replacement of the trial head with a comparable definitive metallic head by impaction with the **NAME[UUU] taper.  Final reduction was performed.  Hard copy images were obtained.  Pulsatile jet lavage was completed.  A small Hemovac drain was inserted.  The deep fascia was closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous layers and skin were closed with resorbable sutures in conventional fashion.  Steri-Strips, dry, and OpSite dressings were added.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, and was transferred to the recovery room in good condition.
