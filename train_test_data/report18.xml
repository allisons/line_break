ED COURSE:  
The patient was seen and examined by myself and by my attending, Dr. **NAME[ZZZ]. 
She was given 30 mg of IV Toradol for pain relief and we ordered an x-ray of the spine to rule out degenerative spondylolisthesis.  The patient's x-ray was read as normal and she was discharged to home with follow-up instructions with Dr. **NAME[TTT] who she has seen in the past for similar back pain issues. 
 She was given a prescription for an MRI of the lumbar spine to rule out spinal stenosis.  It was felt that this could be the cause of her pain judged by her relief from sitting forward.
