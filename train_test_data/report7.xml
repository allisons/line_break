PATIENT NAME:  **NAME[AAA, BBB]
ACCOUNT #:  **ID-NUM
**ROOM
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  **NAME[YYY M ZZZ]
ADMISSION DATE:  **DATE[Feb 02 2007]
EVALUATION DATE:  **DATE[Feb 05 06]
I am seeing this critically ill patient for continued management of multiple medical problems including respiratory failure and volume overload.  I have seen and examined this patient.  I have reviewed the chest x-ray and laboratory data and I have discussed the patient's care with the CT ICU Team and the Lung Transplant Service. Mrs. **NAME[AAA] continues to have her chest open for right ventricular failure.  She has a cardiac index of 4.8 now; however, I am reducing her milrinone from 0.25 to 1.25.  She is also receiving a little bit of epinephrine.  Mean arterial pressures are in the 70's.  CVP is running at 9 and she seems to be having responded well to diuresis.  BUN and creatinine are 29 and 0.9.  She will return to the OR for chest closure either later today or tomorrow. Her urine output has been 2 liters over the last 24 hours, about another liter-and-a-half since midnight.  Arterial blood gas is 7.47, 40, and 93 on 30% FiO2 and 10 of PEEP. I am continuing cefepime, Flagyl, and vancomycin.  I have given her some additional FK today for her FK level of 5. 
T = 38 minutes.
