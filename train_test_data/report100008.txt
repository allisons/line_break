ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Assessment: **AGE[in 60s] yo M with laryngeal ca and recurrent head and neck scc a/w hemoptysis
- - - - -
Problem/Diagnosis 1: Goals;  Assessment/Plans: Met with patient and wife.  Case discussed with heme/onc and ENT.  Patient's priorities are his faith and his family and prolonging his life.  Oncology believes that he may be a chemotherapy candidate if cyberknife next week helps with bleeding and patient can undergo some rehab.
-we can follow along at your request to help define a plan of care c/w his goals  
Problem/Diagnosis 2: Pain;  Assessment/Plans: Chronic OP pain from CA controlled on home methadone.  Pt uses no breakthrough at home and doesn't feel the need for it here.  
-continue methadone 40mg PO TID
-check all new medications for drug-drug interactions with methadone before prescribing
-if breakthough needed, would start with morphine 2mg IV and titrate up as needed because this will likely be too low a dose.  Please page us if help needed although I don't anticipate he will need any breakthrough meds.
Problem/Diagnosis 3: Spirituality;  Assessment/Plans: As above, this is very important to them.  They are non-denominational christian and wife is a minister.  They do not want to see the hospital chaplain
Problem/Diagnosis 4: Support;  Assessment/Plans: Provided support to pt and wife.  Our SW met with wife independently and will help her fill out financial POA forms and any other needs they identify.
Problem/Diagnosis 5: Constipation;  Assessment/Plans: No current.
-monitor with opioids
-continue colace
