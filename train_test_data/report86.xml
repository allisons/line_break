Addendum
FINDINGS:  Ms. **NAME[AAA] had presented to me with a locally advanced pancreatic cancer.  She underwent neoadjuvant radiation chemotherapy with gemcitabine and external beam radiation.  A repeat staging exam showed no evidence of any metastatic disease and evidence of regression of her primary tumor as evidenced by the recannulization of the portal vein.  She desired exploration.  I discussed with her, her daughter, and her husband the risks and benefits of this, as well as the chance that this would still be unresectable, despite the improvement on the CAT scan.  I discussed with them the possibility of surgical bypass if it was found to be unresectable, as well as the risks of a Whipple procedure including bleeding, infection, and leak from the pancreatic anastomosis.  She considered her options carefully and she asked me to proceed.  
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the operating room, placed in the supine position after induction of general anesthesia, and the abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  We began our exploration through a midline incision.  We dissected down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  Once inside the abdominal cavity, we found a large phlegmon in the right upper quadrant, which was, in fact, a completely necrotic gallbladder that had been walled off by the omentum and the transverse colon mesentery.  We found no evidence of any gross metastatic disease.  We increased the incision to a full length, and then thoroughly explored.  Unfortunately, we found, right at the root of the mesentery, that the tumor was going through to the peritoneal surface.  A shave biopsy of the peritoneum, below the transverse mesocolon, revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma.  We then performed a generous Kocher maneuver and palpated, and in fact, the SMA was completely encased with a firm mass.  I felt at that point that she was clearly locally advanced, and not resectable.  Therefore, I turned my attention to palliating her.  Given the gallbladder was completely necrosed, we had to remove this.  It was basically an empyema that was walled off, as I mentioned, from the omentum in the transverse mesocolon, and the duodenum.  We were not able to completely remove the gallbladder.  We just opened up the gallbladder, evacuated all the purulent material, and then removed the anterior wall of the gallbladder that we shaved off the transverse colon and the duodenum, placing a suture in the cystic duct, which was obviously occluded, as well as she has a stent, so there was no evidence of bile leakage backup.  I could not be sure that at the base of the gallbladder, there was not even tumor growing up into this; it was quite firm and difficult to tell whether it was inflammatory and neoplastic.  Once we had completed the cholecystectomy, we obtained hemostasis with electrocautery.  We used the argon beam coagulator to ablate the residual mucosa on the posterior wall of the gallbladder.  We then performed a surgical gastrojejunostomy using a blue load of the GIA stapler.  We brought this back down through the transverse mesocolon and then secured it here.  We oversewed the suture line with 3-0 Biosyn and 3-0 silk sutures.  I then placed a gastrojejunostomy feeding tube, for both decompression and for feeding.  We fed this through the gastrojejunostomy into the distal afferent limb, and then secured it to the anterior abdominal wall, where we had brought it through.  Of note, this large mass in the gallbladder fossa was also impinging on the duodenum.  During her endoscopic ultrasound, she, in fact, had a very narrowed first portion of the duodenum that they could not pass the ultrasound probe through, so therefore, that is why I made the decision to perform a gastrojejunostomy, as I thought this would give her good palliation of eating should she develop a further gastric outlet obstruction.  Then, after obtaining hemostasis, I inspected for surgical instruments.  I found none.  I placed a quarter-inch round JP in the right upper quadrant.  I then closed the fascia with #1 interrupted Vicryl sutures. 
The skin was closed with staples.  
ATTESTATION STATEMENT:  I was present and scrubbed for the entire procedure here.
