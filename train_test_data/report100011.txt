ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Assessment: Mr **NAME[AAA] is a 64 year olf genetleman with history of CHF, CLL, Hep C with HCC  and paranoid schizophrenia and is now admitted with chest pain and decompensated heart failure. He is refusing treatment with diuretics and we have been consulted to discuss goals of care.
1) Goals of Care: Patient has capacity to make his treatment decisions, he has good understanding of his heart failure and does not want treatment for it. 
-- He feels that diuretics makes him urinate alot and do not help him with his CHF symptoms,  thus, he does not want diuretics. 
-- He would just like to have medication for pain management and breathlessness. As per patient his main goal will be to stay comfortable and pain free.
-- He does not want interventions that may prolong his life. He expressed that he would not like to be intubated or ressusicated, or to be on any artificial life support.
-- Patient agrees to visit Hepatology clinic where he would like to get information regarding treatment options and would decide upon them.
-- Given his Class IV heart failure and Hep C with Hepatocellular Ca, he has poor prognosis with estimated survival of weeks to months. He understands that and would like to be symptom free during this period.
-- He should be discharged to home with long acting NSAIDs, albuterol inhaler or nebulization and follow up in palliative care clinic and hepatology clinic.
-- He agrees that for symptomatic management, he would rather follow up in palliative care clinic than coming to the hospital. Patient should follow up with Dr. **NAME[XXX] at **INSTITUTION at **INSTITUTION. Phone Number is **PHONE.
-- Palliative care social worker will assess his living situation in detail. We will see if patient has any options for shelters where home hospice/home palliative care services can be provided. Patient is willing to talk about this.
2) Pain Management: Experienced adverse effects of Naproxen. We will stop it. We will recommend Hepatic adjusted dose of Ibuprofen, 400mg po bid. Tramadol can also be used.
3) Dyspnea: We will recommend propping up patient in bed and administering bronchodilator nebs. Continue fluid restriction if patient agrees to it. Upon discharge, we will recommend giving him prescription for Albuterol Nebs. Case was discussed with Dr. **NAME[XXX].
