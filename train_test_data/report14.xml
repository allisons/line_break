The lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive active Bowel sounds are present. 
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. CBC was obtained which showed a white blood cell count of 15.2, H&amp;H 11.3 and 32.5, platelets 176. A CT of the orbits were obtained which revealed left facial and preseptal periorbital inflammation consistent with cellulitis.  Her orbital contents and globes are intact.  There are no bony lesion.  There is some mild mucosal thickening of the inferior aspects of the maxillary sinuses.  The remaining sinuses are clear. 
ED COURSE:  
This is a **AGE[in 20s]-year-old with left eye cellulitis.  CT was obtained to rule out eye involvement.  Per the CT there was no orbital content involvement.  The patient  did receive Unasyn 3 gram IV while in the Emergency Department, as well as, Dilaudid for pain control.  Due to the fact that there is no eye involvement, it was felt that the patient  could be treated with p.o. antibiotics. 
The patient was discharged to home.  She was given a prescription for Bactrim DS b.i.d. to take for 10 days.  She was told to follow up with her PCP tomorrow. She states she will call them tomorrow and be seen or return to the Emergency Department.  The patient  was understanding of all of the instructions and in agreement with the plan. 
The case was discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] who is in full agreement with the plan.
