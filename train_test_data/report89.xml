DATE OF ADMISSION:  **DATE[Jul 26 2006]
DATE OF CONSULTATION:  **DATE[Aug 07 06]  
REASON FOR CONSULTATION: 
1. Discussion of goals of care.
2. Center management.
HPI:
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 50s]-year-old white man who was admitted, on **DATE[Jul 26 2006]. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure status post heart transplant in 2004. He had previously had a history of heart failure, coronary artery disease, high lipids, and high blood pressure. Another pertinent positive is the patient has a long history of medical noncompliance. For instance, he stopped taking one of his transplant medicines in **DATE[Mar], secondary to finances. He said until about four weeks ago, he was able to walk one-half mile at a time. The last two to three weeks; however, he has been short of breath really at rest and with minimal exertion. He came in on **DATE[Jul 26] and had been diuresed. He has been on dobutamine. Today, milrinone was started. The patient says he would like to go home and we were asked to see if we could help with symptoms and help facilitate end-of-life conversation. 
MEDICATIONS:   
Current medicines are milrinone, Lasix, Prandin, dobutamine, Prograf, Protonix, Celexa 10, "Allcept," Tylenol, Lipitor, trazodone, and senna.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
1. Hypertension.
2. COPD.
3. Osteoarthritis.
4. High lipids.
5. Otherwise, cardiac history is as per above. 
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Hospital course is as per above. The patient has had little response to IV
 Lasix. He has had bumping in creatinine from a baseline of 1.4, now, to almost 3. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
The patient describes some pain between his scapula in his back. He describes his appetite as okay. He is currently not having any constipation. When asked if he is depressed, he said, "slightly," however, he does not fulfill the criteria for depression, in that he has not felt down more often than not for more than two weeks. He has no anhedonia. Additional symptoms, as per above.
SOCIAL HISTORY: 
He has two children who live with his ex-wife. He has a daughter of 16 and a son who is 23. He worked building furniture. The primary cardiology has spoken to his ex-wife and the plan is for the patient, if he goes home, to stay with his ex-wife and children. He has a girlfriend who he describes a great relationship with. The patient was previously living in an apartment in an old motel.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
Sitting in bed, he appears comfortable. He is in no respiratory distress. He is able to speak clearly. He has jugular venous distention. He has some small crackles with decreased breath sounds of both lower lungs with no wheezing and good air movement.  Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm, with an S3. His abdomen is distended but he has normoactive bowel sounds.  He has trace lower extremity edema.
LABS:
Hematocrit is 36. Creatinine is 2.7. Sodium is 128. LFTs are normal.
Chest x-ray, of **DATE[Aug 03 2006], shows pulmonary congestion with right pleural effusion.
ASSESSMENT:   
A **AGE[in 50s]-year-old man with a history of status post transplant with history of heart failure.
PLAN:
1. For the patient's abdominal pain, which he describes as constant and dull, the recommendation would be rather than to use morphine, to use Dilaudid 0.4
 mg - 0.6 mg q. 2 hours p.r.n.  The patient says he is willing to ________ and we will use long-acting medicine if necessary, based on his p.r.n. use. 
2. GI. Continue Senna and Colace.
3. Mood. I think he might benefit slightly from increasing his Celexa from
 10-20. He said the Celexa has helped his mood.
GOALS:
We discussed this along with the patient. He clearly says that he does not want to be intubated, does not want to be shocked. He knows that he has a life-threatening illness that he could die from. He is not unnecessarily afraid of death. He said his main goal is to be comfortable and be at home. He does hope for the future. Specifically, he hopes that the milrinone will work. He does have a girlfriend whom he is very much in love with. He is not particularly tearful, nor, again, does he have a very depressed affect. He would be appropriate for hospice if he goes home, he understands that, and would actually like that. 
Our plan will be to see how the medicines work and help facilitate discharge to hospice if indicated.
