PATIENT NAME:  **NAME[AAA, BBB]
ACCOUNT #:  **ID-NUM 
DATE OF SERVICE:  **DATE[Jun 14 06] 
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: **NAME[VVV]  **NAME[UUU]
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dizziness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is Chinese speaking and speaks very little English, so this history was primarily obtained through an Chinese translator over the telephone.  The patient reportedly states that he has had dizziness for approximately one week and some intermittent shortness of breath, which has been worsening.  He states that he has been on hydrochlorothiazide, but did not take it prior to one week, secondary to having checked his blood pressure at **INSTITUTION and found it to be low.  He also reports some leg heaviness, which has been present for at least three to four months.  He also reports some occasional palpitations.  He denies any weakness.  He does reports some dizziness, but denies vertiginous symptoms.  He reports occasional headaches over the past six months, but denies any current headaches.  He denies any recent visual changes.  He states that he read up on heart failure and is afraid that he has heart failure.  He went to see his primary care physician, but she was not open over the weekend.  
Therefore, the patient did come to the Emergency Department for evaluation. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
The patient denies any current chest pain, dyspnea, diaphoresis, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hematochezia.  He denies dysuria, hematuria, and unilateral weakness, numbness or tingling.  He does report a chronic cough.

ED COURSE:  
The patient did receive aspirin 81 mg p.o. times four.  We did attempt to contact the patient's family members or next of kin, but we were unable to do so.  We did speak to the patient via translator over the phone and he is aware that he will be admitted for workup of this.  We did speak with the A Service attending and they did agree to accept the patient to their service.  
 
MEDICAL DECISION-MAKING:  The patient is an **AGE[in 80s]-year-old gentleman with history of hypertension who presents today with reported dizziness, occasional palpitations and possibly worsening shortness of breath.  The lab work here is within normal limits.  The troponin is pending.  EKG is within normal limits, revealing normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 69.  I did not suspect pulmonary embolus.  I do not suspect acute CVA or TIA.  The patient is neurologically intact currently with symmetric strength and sensation bilaterally with cranial nerves intact.   
The patient will be admitted to rule out acute coronary syndrome.  
DIAGNOSIS(ES):  
DIZZINESS.
DISPOSITION:  Admission to A Service, monitored bed, stable medical condition.
