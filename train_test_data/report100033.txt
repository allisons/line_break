ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Assessment: **AGE[in 70s] yo female w/ a h/o ESRD s/p failed kidney transplant, CAD s/p CABG/AVR on coumadin, admitted with bleeding AV fistula with hospital course c/b SAH, small bowel volvulus, GI bleed, and STEMI, now w/ continuing abdominal pain and decreased PO intake.
1. Pain:
a) Abdominal Pain: Unclear etiology for pain - possibly secondary to recent surgery or mesenteric ischemia, as it appears to be exacerbated signficantly by PO intake. Abdominal pain is in good control with current opiate dosage.
b) Hip Pain: Recently had hip replacement. Has pain since then. Says that pain has aggravated though. Given history of bacteremia, there is chance of seeding, however, cultures have been negative for some time so it not very likely.
c) Back Pain/leg pain: Chronic. Similar in intesity as she experiences at home.
--Patient was initially started on Fentanyl and Hydromorphone PCA, but was not using PCA appropraitely. Therefore was switched to short acting oral hydromorphone for breakthtrough pain.
-- She seems to have responed to this pain regimen. On **DATE[Nov 03 2009]  she required additional pain medications to control her pain. This was in setting of the fact that she recieved 4mg Dilaudid, which is half of maximum dose she can get, that was unable to relieve her pain and she required more. Overall the amount of opiate used on **DATE[Nov 03 2009]  was same as that used on **DATE[Nov 02 2009]. We will recommend discontinuing order for 4mg Dilaudid and administer 8mg only on prn basis. This will reduce the confusion and will provide optimal pain control, hopefully without requiring additional doses.
-- Continue amitriptyline.
2. She also appears to have a mild hypoactive delirium, possibly secondary to her acute illness/hospitalization/pain.
-- Haldol 0.5mg Q12hrs.
-- Mental status is same: but much improved when she was not takiung haldol.
3. Goals of Care: After meetings with daughters following was defined.
-- Patient wants to focus on two things: Pain control and staying at home.
-- Does not want artificial support, and wants to be DNR/DNI. Does not want feeding tube.
-- Prefers symptomatic relief and staying with family over life prolongation.
-- Both patient and family does not want the patient to go to a nursing home. 
-- Plan was to transfer to TCU at **INSTITUTION or Montefiore for continuation of antibiotics (nafcillin), which were intially dosed Q4hrs. Transfer has not been possible because of lack of availability of beds.
-- Now the dosage schedule has been changed to Q24hrs continuous Nafcillin. This will be much easier to be administered at home.
-- We have arranged family meeting again **DATE[Nov 04 2009]  at 1:00PM. Will discuss:
a) Goals of care. If priorities are as listed above and given patient's poor appetite and mental status, she has life expectancy of weeks, transfer to home with palliative care or hospice service may be appropriate.
b) Assessment of requirements and arrangement for transfer including home care nursing for antibiotic administeration and durable medical equipment required.
Findings and plan were discussed with Dr. **NAME[XXX].

Family/PCP Discussions1:  Date: **DATE[Nov 04 2009];  Resident: **NAME[VVV] with pt, two daughters, PNCC, attending physician and palliative care SW.  Discussed pt's continued lack of PO intake, persistent delirium and anemia. Given these findings and poor functional status, prognosis likely days-weeks.  Pt's priorities are being home and symptom control.  Suggested DC home with palliative home care for sx mgmt and continuation of IV nafcillin.  Suggested that at some point, dialysis may become a burden to patient.  Daughter, Robin, notes she is not ready for her mom to stop dialysis.  We discussed the posibility of transitioning to hospice should the pt and her family decide to stop dialysis.  Family agreed that goal is comfort and do not plan on re-admitting pt to the hospital.  We will plan on DC to home Sunday afternoon with Family Hospice and Palliative care providing home palliative care.

TEACHING PHYSICIAN ATTESTATION: GC; I saw and evaluated the patient. Discussed with resident and agree with resident's findings and plan as documented in the resident's note.; I saw the patient on: **DATE[Nov 04 2009]; With the addition of: Goals of care are comfort.  Would continue dialysis per family's wishes.  Would stop checking labs unless related to dialysis.  Family understands that as time progresses, pt may no longer be physically able to withstand dialysis and this may become a burden.  She would be able to transition to hospice care at the point of stopping dialysis.  Would DC the following medications as they are not contrinbuting to her comfort:  ASA, plavix, MVI, pravastatin, coumadin.
