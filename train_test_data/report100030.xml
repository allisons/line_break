**INSTITUTION PALLIATIVE CARE PROGRESS NOTE
- - - - -
DATE: **DATE[Nov 03 2009]
- - - - -
Chief Complaint:  Dyspnea and depression
- - - - -
SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS
Physical: Patient c/o generalized discomfort and pain.  Experiences dyspnea following conversation ( with speaking valve in place ) after 10 minutes. Generalized weakness
Psychological: Patient states she is tired of being in the hospital and confined to bed unable to eat or even hold things in her hands without dropping them.
Goals of care: Patient wishes to stop all treatments and pursue hospice care in an inpatient unit closer to home.; Discussed goals of care with patient.  She has a clear understanding of her disabilites.  Informed us that she was "an athletic person" and cannot tolerate living life with a prosthesis on HD and being unable to eat.  She states that she has been trying to proceed with recommended care in hopes of improving but does not feel that she will be able to reach a quality of life that is acceptable to her.  **NAME[BBB] defines quality of life as being independent physically without a prosthesis not being on HD and being able to eat and drink what she wants.  **NAME[BBB] has worked as a hospice volunteer before her MI and possess a good understanding of  hospice value and goals.  **NAME[CCC BBB] would prefer to be closer to home in **PLACE NY for her inpatient hospice care.
Another concern **NAME[BBB] expressed is that her symptoms could be managed at EOL. She was afraid that support would simply be pulled and she could not recieve medications.  I assured her that we or her hospice team would be sure to manage symptoms of pain dyspnea and emotional distress at end of life.  **NAME[BBB] requested that we talk with her family and primary team about her decision.  **NAME[VVV] Walk Palliative care SW is to speak with patient's husband this afternoon and hopefully meet with them over the weekend. I have spoken with **NAME[UUU] the nurse practitioner from the primary team who is to relay the content of our conversation to Dr. **NAME[XXX].      I also assured **NAME[UUU] that Palliative care would take the lead in coordinating transfer to an inpatient hospice for **NAME[BBB] closer to her home in **PLACE NY.  We will continue to talk with the primary to keep them update with our progress.
REC: My recommendation would be no elevation of care.  Allow patient to refuse care as she deems appropriate.
Plan:  **NAME[VVV] Walk to meet with patient's husband on Sunday **DATE[Nov 5]th. 
Palliative care will continue to follow the patient to coordinate transfer to inpatient hospice facility and manage symptoms at EOL.
Family Issues: Patient states that initially her husband and son were trying to convince her to continue therapy and try to rehab but now they are supportive of her decision to pursue comfort care.
