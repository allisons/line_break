DATE OF ADMISSION:  **DATE[Nov 04 2009]
DATE OF CONSULTATION:  **DATE[Nov 06 09]
 
 
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:  We were asked by Dr. **NAME[WWW] to see Ms. **NAME[AAA] for goals of care.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Information is obtained from the electronic medication and from meeting with the patient's family and talking to her nephew on the phone, prior to meeting, as the patient is unable to participate in the history given or decisions based on her current mental status.  I also did speak with the primary team and consultants from Hepatology.  
 
The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old white female with a past medical history significant for cirrhosis secondary to **NAME[VVV], Child's class B, MELD score 25, who sustained a hip fracture on the right this weekend and upper GI bleed, who we are asked to see for goals of care.  The patient had a fall and would not go to the hospital for awhile on Sunday, despite her family's efforts and EMS being called a couple times. She eventually presented with hematemesis on Monday, when she was then willing to go to the hospital.  She presents to an outside hospital where she was found to have an NG tube aspirate consistent with bleeding and melena.  On rectal exam she also had hemoglobin approximately 6, coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia.  She was sent to **INSTITUTION for further evaluation.  Since then she has been in an ICU.  She has had an EGD with  banding of esophageal varices, although they were not felt to be the acute  cause of bleeding.  She did also have an duodenal ulcer.  She has become  encephalopathic and delirious during this admission.  She has had films, which  have confirmed a right intertrochanteric fracture. She is being evaluated by  the Orthopedic Surgery Service. 
 
With respect to symptoms, on speaking with the bedside nurse, the patient does complain of pain in her hip. She also has times where she is more lucid than others.  When I saw her in the morning, she was complaining of hip pain intermittently falling asleep.  The primary team is adjusting her analgesics.  The patient is unable to give me any other symptoms or history as she does not stay awake through the interview.
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
1. Cirrhosis Child's class C secondary to **NAME[VVV], complicated by SIADH use, currently complicated by GI bleed, thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy and encephalopathy.  
2. Hyperlipidemia.
3. Diabetes mellitus.
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS, NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Are in the electronic medical record and have been reviewed. 
1. They are significant for Unasyn.
2. She has multiple one time orders for fentanyl both 50 and 100 mcg doses.
3. She also had a couple 0.5 mg doses of Dilaudid yesterday.
4. She is on insulin sliding scale.
5. She had lactulose started this morning at 15 grams by mouth every 8 hours.
6. IV PPI around-the-clock.
7. Bisacodyl suppository p.r.n. No doses in the past 48 hours.
8. Dilaudid, she got a couple doses of 1 mg.  She was most recently order 0.5 mg.
9. Zofran p.r.n. No doses in the past 24 hours.
10. Potassium.
11. Electrolyte replacement.
12. Octreotide infusion, almost since admission.
 
FAMILY HISTORY:  She has multiple family members including a brother and sister with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, per her brother, was, in fact, listed for transplant at one point and ended up being off the transplant list and pursuing hospice care.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives by herself in **PLACE PA.  She has a very involved family.  She officially does not need a power-of-attorney for health care decisions.  Her family is trying to make these decisions together.  One of her nephews, who has tried to be very involved, his name is Mark **NAME[AAA], his phone number is **PHONE.  His brother is **NAME[CCC AAA], his phone number is **PHONE, a niece is **NAME[YYY DDD], she works at **INSTITUTION and Clinic.  They were all at the meeting today and I spoke with Mark on the phone this morning.  The patient has in the past acted in such a fashion to let her family know that living independently and living in her own home was very important to her. Her family had wanted her to go a nursing home for the past year and a half and the patient has been unwilling to consider this.  The patient did live independently. She had family members bring her food and in the past two weeks had family members, specifically, her sister prepare her meals.   She lived in a two-story home with bathroom not on the main living level and would have trouble getting upstairs to her own bedroom.  
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unobtainable based on the patient's mental status.  The family does note that the patient has pain from her complications from her diabetes and they also think that she was depressed.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature afebrile, heart rate 85, respirations 11, saturations 97% on two liters nasal cannula and the last blood pressure was from 2 p.m. and was 140/41.  In general, she is lying in bed in no acute distress, intermittently complaining of pain.  HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic. Sclerae with mild icterus.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Lymph nodes: No supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy appreciated.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  Abdomen with normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nondistended with no rebound or guarding. The patient reports some pain with palpation.  Extremities: Her right lower extremity is externally rotated and foreshortened. She has palpable pulses in both feet.  Skin:  Mild jaundice. Scattered ecchymosis.  Neuro: Intermittently falling asleep, intermittently following commands. CAM is positive.  Positive asterixis.  
 
LABS:  Reviewed from this morning, they are significant for a sodium 140, chloride 110, her BUN this morning is 87, creatinine 1.7. Calcium was 9.1.  Her most recent LFTs are from yesterday with an albumin of 2.6, total protein 5.2 and her total bilirubin 8.7 with a direct component of 2.8.  Her ALT was 109, AST 142 with an alkaline phosphatase 101.  Her lactate yesterday was 1.8 and 1.6 today.  Her ammonia this morning was 44.  CBC from this morning reveals a white blood cell count 8.7 with 77% neutrophils, 10% lymphocytes.  Her hemoglobin was 9.3, which is slightly down with a normal MCV, wide RDW and her platelets are 50 today.  Her INR is 1.9 with a PTT of 36.6.  
 
IMAGING: She had a chest x-ray from this morning that shows large bibasilar atelectasis, but no effusions.  Hip films from yesterday showed a comminuted intertrochanteric fracture of the right hip.  Abdominal ultrasound on **DATE[Nov 05] showed cirrhosis, patent hepatic vessels, mild ascites with normal direction of flow for all major hepatic vessels. She had an EGD on **DATE[Nov 05], which showed grade 2 esophageal varices, which were banded, congestive gastropathy and duodenitis without hemorrhage.  
 
She had an EKG on **DATE[Nov 04] with QTC of 479.  
 
ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
 
The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old white female with diabetes, cirrhosis secondary to **NAME[VVV] with a MELD score greater than 25 and a right hip fracture, who we are seeing for goals of care.
 
1. Goals of care:  I spent time on the phone this morning with her nephew, Mark, and then met with two of her nephews and a niece, along with the PNCC from the primary team. I also spoke with the Liver fellow on the phone and in person and Dr. **NAME[WWW], the CCM attending.  It seems as if the patient in the past had not wanted to live in a nursing home.  She has also not been eager to seek medical attention for medical issues.  It sounds that her functional status at home was declining with depression and a relatively unacceptable quality of life for her at baseline.  The family is hoping that she will be able to make decisions and we will try and clear her mental status as best as possible. They understand that may not be possible.  They are interested in gathering further information from the Liver team and from the Orthopedic Surgeon about risks and benefits of possible interventions and if there is any hope that her liver disease would get better.  I have spoken to the Liver team and relayed to the family that she is not a transplant candidate.  I have also relayed a prognosis just from her liver disease that is on the order of weeks to months.  We are going to gather information with the family and they are going to talk with the patient's sisters.  We will try to be available to help think about any decisions that they need to make in the near future.  
2. Delirium:  She has likely encephalopathy and delirium. The primary team is trying to manage these by minimizing offending  medications, specifically her opiates, although she clearly needs pain control and uncontrolled pain could lead to delirium also.  We are limited in our adjuvants for her pain control, given her thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction and liver disease, so opiates are a reasonable choice.  She is on Lactulose, which will hopefully clear some of the encephalopathy.  Additionally, you could try low doses of Haldol 0.5 mg every six hours and every four hours as needed.  
3. Pain:  The primary team is trying to manage this as best as possible, as above we are limited with our adjuvants because of her thrombocytopenia, renal failure and liver disease.  They are working with opiates and it is reasonable to use Dilaudid given her renal failure with the 0.5 mg dose IV, as they have ordered.  We will also get a surgical opinion as to whether surgery may help provide analgesia.  
 
Greater than 120 minutes was spent on this encounter, with greater than 50% of the time counseling and coordinating care.
 
Thank you very much for allowing us to participate in the care of **NAME[BBB AAA] and we will continue to see her at your request.
