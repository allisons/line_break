ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Assessment: ESLD secondary to PSC not a transplant candidate s/p ICU stay secondary to bacteremia and peritonitis
- - - - -
Problem/Diagnosis1: 293.0: Delirium, d/t conditions classified elsewhere; multifactorial: prolonged hospitalization, hepatic failure, recovering sepsis;  Assessment/Plans: appers to be improving.  Can also have risperidone 0.25 q6 PRN available for agitation Problem/Diagnosis2: Goals of care;  Assessment/Plans: family meeting **DATE[Nov 1 2009] with girlfriend and other family to determine best site of care.  Dr. **NAME[UUU] requesting Palliative care SW to be in attendance. Need to eluciadate what is improtant to the family about the way that the patient lives.  If QOl is most iporttant and getting h8m home vs. quantity of life, I agree that further lifelimiting infections should not be treated and he should not be transferred to the ICU.  In addition, if current QOL is not acceptable, could argue to stop his midodrine and octreotide as well.  If QOl is what is important, would not add additional agents/therapies that will get him further away from goal(if it be home).  Of note, pt's addressis listed as Windber.  There is an inpt hospice unit there.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Other: Discussed with dr. **NAME[UUU] and his team.  Family meeting at 4PM.  He requests Pall care SW to be present.
