**INSTITUTION
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT
PATIENT NAME:  **NAME[AAA, BBB]
ACCOUNT #:  **ID-NUM 
DATE OF SERVICE:  **DATE[Feb 17 06] 
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: A  N
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN ADDENDUM:
This patient was seen in conjunction with the Trauma Service as a level two trauma.  I was present for the patient's initial evaluation by the Trauma Service.  I did review the trauma flow sheet and agreed with its content unless noted otherwise below.   
This is a **AGE[in teens]-year-old female patient who was the unrestrained driver in a motor vehicle collision.  The vehicle reportedly flipped and did shear off a utility pole.  The patient denies striking her head, although she was noted to have an occipital scalp laceration.  She denied any loss of consciousness with this.  She denies any complaints of neck pain.  No chest pain.  No abdominal pain.  She states that she is having pain at present to her right upper arm, as well as her left calf.  She denies any numbness or weakness in her extremities.  The patient's review of systems is as above.  The remaining systems were negative. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
None.
MEDICATIONS:
Oral contraceptives.
ALLERGIES:
THE PATIENT HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. 
TETANUS:
The patient was unsure of her last tetanus immunization.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Negative for alcohol use.  
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
The patient's physical examination showed her to be awake and alert in no distress.  Her GCS was 15.  Vital signs upon arrival to the trauma bay showed her to have a blood pressure of 122/84, pulse rate 88, respirations 16, oxygen saturation 98% on room air, and temperature 36.7.  The patient's HEENT showed her to have a 2 cm laceration on the occipital region of the scalp.  
Her pupils were equal and reactive.  Extraocular movements were intact.  The patient's TMs were clear bilaterally.  The patient's neck was without cervical spine tenderness.  The patient's oropharynx showed no evidence of intraoral trauma.  The chest was nontender on palpation.  Breath sounds were equal bilaterally.  The heart was normal S1 and S2.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  The pelvis was nontender on palpation.  The patient did have some pain on palpation to the soft tissue of the right upper arm, as well as to the calf muscles in the left leg.  Neurologic examination showed intact motor and sensory function.   
ED COURSE:
The patient's ED course did consist of a chest x-ray showing no evidence of acute rib fractures or pneumothorax.  Pelvis x-ray was limited but showed no gross evidence of fracture.  The patient's H&amp;H was 14.6 and 45.  Glucose was 95, sodium 143, potassium 4.1.  The patient did undergo a CT scan of the head showing no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.  CT scan of the cervical spine was negative for any evidence of fracture or subluxation.  CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis ruled out fracture, thoracic or abdominal injury.  The laceration was repaired by the Trauma Service with staples here in the Emergency Department under my supervision.  The patient did also have a CT scan of the thoracic spine which did have preliminary read of possible compression fracture at T8.  This was relayed to the Trauma Service.  The patient will be admitted to the Trauma Service at this time for further evaluation, management and observation. 
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS(ES):
1. CLOSED HEAD INJURY.  
2. 2 cm OCCIPITAL SCALP LACERATION.
3. MULTIPLE CONTUSIONS.
4. POSSIBLE T8 COMPRESSION FRACTURE.
