**INSTITUTION 
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT
PATIENT NAME:  **NAME[AAA, BBB M]
ACCOUNT #:  **ID-NUM
DATE OF SERVICE:  **DATE[Feb 07 06]
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: **NAME[UUU TTT SSS]
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN ADDENDUM:  
The patient was seen and examined by myself. The resident's H&amp;P was reviewed and the nursing sheet was reviewed. Medical decision-making was made simultaneously with the resident. 
Chief complaint: Dizzy. HPI: The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old gentleman who had very nonspecific complaints of feeling sort of weak and dizzy today when he was coming down some stairs. He did not pass out. He did not fall. The wife got concerned and called paramedics to come bring him to the Emergency Department. He really cannot describe his dizziness and might be slightly orthostatic. He was in a standing position the entire time and he was going down some stairs and felt unsteady, sort of a little off balance, but he really describes no vertigo and this has not persisted. He feels fine at this time. He has had no chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, urinary complaints, and he feels much better at this time. The wife is concerned. She did not see any facial droop. She did not see any focal neurologic signs at all and he is not complaining of any.  
Review of systems is otherwise negative. Medical history, medications, allergies, and social history are per the resident note.  
Physical exam: He is awake, alert, and vigorous appearing in no obvious distress. Vital signs are as documented. He is not subjectively orthostatic. 
Blood pressure is stable. HEENT exam: Pupils are equal, they react to light. The oropharynx is patent and clear. Neck is supple without JVD or adenopathy. 
Heart: Regular, there is no murmur, rub, or gallop. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The extremities have no edema. Skin is warm, dry, and well perfused. Neurologic exam. Strength and sensation in the upper and lower extremities are unremarkable. He has a normal gait for  a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old gentleman. He is not ataxic. No pronator drift. His cranial nerves II through XII appear to be grossly intact.  While in the ED, the patient did have an evaluation which was reviewed, including labs and CT scan. These were all reviewed and relatively unremarkable, except for some old lacunes on the CT of the head. There are some minimal ischemic changes in the periventricular white matter.  
EKG INTERPRETATION: Sinus rhythm, rate at 81. QTC was slightly prolonged at 506. Left axis deviation does appear to have a right bundle branch block. I cannot find any old cardiograms on this gentleman dating back to 2000. I do not have an old one to compare this to; however, I am not sure of the clinical significance of this at this time.  
As I said, the patient was ambulatory here. He feels fine and he has no complaints at this time and would like to go home.  
Assessment: 
1. DIZZINESS RESOLVED, UNCLEAR ETIOLOGY, AND VERY NONSPECIFIC.
2. RIGHT BUNDLE BRANCH BLOCK, UNCLEAR SIGNIFICANCE, LIKELY CHRONIC. 
3. HISTORY OF LYMPHOMA, TREATED. 
Plan:
At this time, I would like to discharge the patient. They are comfortable going home and the patient would like to go home. I told them specifically, however, if he had any changes, if he develops any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any further changes at all, then he needs to return to the Emergency Department or call his doctor immediately. They are very comfortable with these instructions and the patient was discharged in stable and improved condition.
