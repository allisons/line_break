Physical: Patient denies any symptoms, with her permission we held a family meeting in her room with the dtr being present as well. We asked her understanding of her illness, to which she said that it is the same, unable to elucidate further but when we told her about the condition she agreed to most everything we said saying hmm- uhmmm  indicating yes. We also talked about her getting a defibrillator to which she said no consistently (if the stent didn't work, she didn't want anything else). When we addressed resuscitation- patient said she would like to have attempted resuscitation but was unable to process further- about being on a respirator, having CPR. She was unable to explain to me the reasons behind her apparently conflicting wishes for no defibrillator and yes to resuscitation. She may be afraid of surgery however.

DVT Prophylaxis:Heparin
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Assessment: **AGE[in 60s] yo woman with ICM and poor adherence to medical regimen with recurrent CHF and R pleural effusion.  Delirium appears to be improving.
- - - - -
Problem/Diagnosis 1: Delirium, decreased cognitive function; Plan: Patient lethargic after the initial conversation, was dozing by the time we finished talking. 
Problem/Diagnosis 2: Dyspnea; Plan: Responding to Milrinone, currently asymptomatic
Problem/Diagnosis 3: Goals of care; Plan: dtr is going to ask her 5 brothers to see whether they are willing to participate in their mother's care and about assigning responsibility to be a decision maker in the face of patient's inability to make decisions (from previous psych eval). Patient is uncomfortable with the word 'die'. The dtr is agreeable to arranging her meds weekly but unsure of whether she will take them without daily supervision. Pt reluctant to go to a NH. Sons have traditionally not been very interested in their mother's care. Dtr appeared hesitant to take the responsibility and her comprehension of the entire situation is questionable as well. She seemed to take cues from what we said but would immediately get alarmed by any mention of compromized kidney function which we explained to her repeatedly. Patient remains full code for now. Plan for family meeting again next week with more members of the family present.  
Problem/Diagnosis 4: CHF
Problem/Diagnosis 5: ARF
