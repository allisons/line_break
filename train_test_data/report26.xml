ASSESSMENT 
This is a pleasant **AGE[in 70s]-year-old woman with multiple risk factors with probably known underlying cardiac disease presenting with hypoglycemic causing a bump in her troponin.  She has no cardiovascular symptoms.  No EKG changes.  We will check an echocardiogram.  She should undergo a dialysis to have fluid removal to treat her congestive heart failure.  If her echocardiogram shows good LV function, we will proceed with an adenosine stress for risk stratification tomorrow, as long as there is no significant ischemia due to her lack of symptoms.  We will continue to treat her medically, which include a statin beta-blocker.  Consider adding a low dose aspirin to her Coumadin, if there is not an elevated bleeding risk.  We will add Crestor 5 mg a day for now given her history to intolerance of Lipitor in the past.
