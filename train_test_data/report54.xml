ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  **NAME[YYY M ZZZ]
ADMISSION DATE:  **DATE[May 03 2007]
EVALUATION DATE:  **DATE[May 08 06]
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient states that he is feeling somewhat better.  However, he is still febrile.  I checked his temperature; it is 102.2.  He states that he has some pain on his right side of his chest with deep inspiration. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On his exam today, his lungs revealed some crackles at its bases bilaterally, right greater than left.  Oxygen was in the low 90s on 2 L nasal cannula.  His heart was regular.  His extremities were without edema. 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1. Pneumonia.  He is on Unasyn and azithromycin, which we will continue.  He remains febrile.  Etiology may be his PE and his pneumonia.  He will stay in the hospital for now. 
2. PE.  His prothrombin time this evening is elevated.  We will discontinue Lovenox therapy.  No further Coumadin, and watch him closely. 
3. Sickle.  We are going to continue O2 therapy.  We will likely need to send him home with some oxygen to prevent sickling of his red cells.
