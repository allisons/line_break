Renal insufficiency.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
This is a very nice **AGE[in 80s]-year-old Caucasian gentleman with a longstanding history of diabetes with what he tells me sounds like retinopathy with retinal bleeding needing laser surgery with hypertension and chronic kidney disease.  He has kidney function in the 20s dating back to 2004 where he had a serum creatinine about 2.4 in **DATE[Feb 2004] which is three years ago.  He also gives me a history of CHF with an echocardiogram from 2004 giving an ejection fraction about 45 percent with mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.  He is admitted with diverticulitis.  He has had some diarrhea and left-sided abdominal pain.  He is being treated with IV fluids and IV antibiotics.  He has been placed on a liquid diet.  He reports making urine okay.  He had ten to twelve days of diarrhea and side pain before he was admitted to the hospital.  He has been eating okay.  He has no emesis.  No nausea.  No dizziness.  No lightheadedness.  No contrast exposure.  No nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.  He does take an occasional Tylenol.  No alternative medicines.  No herbal products.  No GNC products.  Denies any problems with his urine.  No dysuria.  No hematuria and he thinks that he empties okay.  He also reports that he has a good stream.  He does have a history of a prostate biopsy in his past medical history.  No rash.  No joint pains.  No family history of lupus.  No frosty urine.  He does have some dyspnea on exertion times twelve steps which is stable.  He denies any orthopnea.  Denies any chest pain.  No focal numbness or weakness.  No headache.  No fevers.  No chills.

LABORATORY DATA 
Blood cultures are no growth today.  Sodium 137, potassium 4.4, chloride 109, bicarbonate 18, BUN 39, creatinine 2.9.  Yesterday BUN 47 and creatinine 2.9.  On the thirteenth BUN 47 and creatinine 2.6.  On **DATE[Feb 25 04]  BUN 35 and creatinine 2.4.  Calcium was 8.3.  Albumin earlier in the week was 3.7, phosphorus 3, magnesium 1.8.  CBC with a white count of 8.4, hemoglobin 10, hematocrit 28.4.  Platelet count 210.  BNP is only 167 which is not elevated.  Urinalysis shows 1+ blood, leukocyte esterase negative, negative nitrite, 1+ protein.  WBCs is 0 to 5, RBCs are 0 to 5. 
 
DIAGNOSTICS 
Chest x-ray shows linear markings at the left base.  Question atelectasis versus developing infiltrate.      
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
VITALS: Blood pressure is 123/71, temperature 36.8, pulse is 66.  HEENT: Normocephalic/atraumatic.  He has no upper dentures.  LYMPHATIC:  On lymph node examination he has no head or neck lymphadenopathy.  CHEST: Clear to auscultation.  CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rhythm and rate with no rub and jugular venous distention.  ABDOMEN: Belly is soft, nontender, nondistended.  
EXTREMITIES: No edema.  JOINT:  No gross joint deformities.  NEUROLOGIC: He is alert and appropriate.   
 
ASSESSMENT/RECOMMENDATIONS 
1. Acute on chronic renal failure versus progression of his underlying stage IV CKD and I suspect it is the latter. 
a) Check urine studies.
b) Check renal ultrasound with postvoid residuals to rule out easily reversible causes of renal failure such as urinary retention and obstruction. 
c) Agree with gentle IV fluids.
d) Check PTH and ___ level. 
e) The patient is on an angiotensin receptor blocker.
f) Check 24-hour urine for creatinine clearance and protein.
g) Check creatinine kinase. 
h) Dose medications for a low creatinine clearance.
i) Avoid nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, contrast, and other nephrotoxins, if possible. 
2. Metabolic acidosis.  We can add a little bit of bicarbonate to his IV fluids.  This may be exacerbated by his diarrhea. 
3. Proteinuria.
a) Quantify.
b) Send serologic workup.
4. We discussed renal failure and dialysis preparation.  The patient does have a sister-in-law who did dialysis and even at the very best that he has been in our **INSTITUTION database, he is stage IV CKD and should begin education as the natural history of chronic kidney disease is progression. 
 
Thank you so much for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient. 
 Please do not hesitate to call if we can be of any assistance.
