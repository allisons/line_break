**INSTITUTION
PALLIATIVE CARE
CONSULTATION
 
PATIENT NAME:  **NAME[AAA, BBB M]
ACCOUNT #:  **ID-NUM
**ROOM
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  **NAME[ZZZ M YYY], M.D.
CONSULTING PHYSICIAN:  **NAME[WWW M. XXX], TTT], M.D.
DATE OF ADMISSION:  **DATE[Aug 06 2006]
DATE OF CONSULTATION:  **DATE[Aug 06 06]  
 
 
REASON FOR CONSULT:  To evaluate for symptoms.
 
Ms. **NAME[CCC] is a **AGE[in 60s]-year-old woman patient of Dr. **NAME[YYY] and also followed an outpatient by Palliative Care physician Dr. **NAME[SSS RRR].  
 
In brief, the patient is a **AGE[in 60s]-year-old woman with a history of advanced pulmonary hypertension, who has been undergoing workup for heart and lung transplant.  Her symptoms started in 2001 when she had several surgeries after a wrist fracture.  She developed a Raynaud-type of phenomenon and diagnosed with likely systematic sclerosis and pulmonary hypertension.  She had been on IV Flolan since **DATE[Oct 2005].  The patient was seen Dr. **NAME[YYY] and **NAME[RRR] today and was supposed to see the Lung Transplant and get pulmonary function tests but she was admitted fro some congestive heart failure.  
 
Of note, at the current time, the patient was just recently admitted to the room and she says she feels quite actually at her baseline for shortness of breath.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
 
She describes her mood as upbeat.  She describes herself as a realist.  She knows that her illness could quickly be fatal unless she gets a lung transplant.  She also willingly admits that sometimes she is short with people and this has led the team to want her to get a new Behavioral Medicine Psych evaluation.  When we expounded on that with her she describes is as just being frustrated while waiting for a transplant.  She describes her sleep as good.  No pain or shortness of breath.  The patient gets dyspnea on exertion to 20 feet.  
 
 
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications are:
 
1. Magnesium.
2. Flolan.
3. Spironolactone.
4. Lasix.
5. Prevacid.
6. Atarax.
7. K-Dur.
 
Of note, in **DATE[May] she was on Remeron for sleep and depression.  This was actually stopped because the patient says it was not working very well.  Also of note, she saw Dr. **NAME[RRR] today and the patient preferred not starting another medicine, but rather was willing to see our Behavioral Psychiatrist, Dr. **NAME[QQQ PPP].  
 
ALLERGIES:  ASPIRIN.  IV DYE.  
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:
 
She is married.  She has three sons.  One daughter with a head injury.  She did some 11th grade education but did some nursing work, LPN work.  She is sober of alcohol for 24 years.  No drug use.  
 
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother has hypertension.  
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is as per above.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative otherwise, other than stated in the HPI.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
 
She is laying in bed, head elevated about 20 degrees.  She looks in no acute distress.  She has moist mucous membranes.  She has some dusky skin.  
 
LUNGS:  The patient's breathing is course crackles.  No accessory muscle use.
 She is able to speak in full sentences without any problems.

LABORATORY DATA:
 
There is no labs yet drawn today.  The IV therapist is in the room.  Previous creatinine was 1.  Last PFT showed an FEV1 of 50% with diagnosis consistent with severe restriction.  
 
ASSESSMENT:
 
A **AGE[in 60s]-year-old woman with pulmonary hypertension awaiting lung transplant.
 
1. Pruritus.  I would continue the Atarax.  The patient says that it is working well.  Another option, if that does not work well, is to use doxepin
 10 p.o. t.i.d.
2. GI.  The patient has some diarrhea because of her Flolan.  This is unremarkable.  Could try fiber if this becomes more of an issue, like
 FiberCon.
3. PSYCH:  The patient will be seen by Dr. **NAME[QQQ PPP] from Behavioral
 Medicine.
