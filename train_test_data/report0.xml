PROCEDURES:  
 
TITLE OF OPERATION:  IRRIGATION AND DEBRIDEMENT OF LEFT KNEE.
 
ANESTHESIA:  General.
 
COMPLICATIONS:  None.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS(ES):  SEPTIC ARTHRITIS, LEFT KNEE.
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS(ES):  SEPTIC ARTHRITIS, LEFT KNEE.
 
HISTORY AND INDICATIONS:  The patient is a **AGE[in 60s]-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease and hemodialysis with vasculopathy who by history, examination, and laboratory studies had a septic arthritis of the left knee. 
 
Preoperatively, I spoke to the patient at great length.  I spoke to her and her daughter about the risks and benefits of surgical intervention.  We talked about complications of anesthesia, septic arthritis, continued pain, neurovascular surgery, need for future surgeries, soft tissue complications etc.  I explained to that irrigation and debridement of septic arthritis is indicated and we talked about this at great length.  After thorough a discussion about the risks and benefits of surgery, the patient gave informed consent. 
 
DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  The patient was identified as the patient.  She was taken to the operating room where she was placed supine on a table.  
Anesthesia had attempted to place a block; however, this did not work and therefore she  needed to be intubated.  After successful intubation, a nonsterile tourniquet was carefully placed high in the left thigh.  The left leg was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion while making sure to isolate the left foot on which she had surgery a few days prior.  The leg was elevated for 120 seconds and then the tourniquet was inflated.  A small approximately 5 cm parapatellar arthrotomy was performed sharply with a knife.  This was taken down into the joint sharply.  Immediately significant amount of cloudy-looking fluid came out of the knee.  This was sent for culture.  After evacuating the fluid, the knee was pulse irrigated with 3 L of solution.  After this, we reexamined the knee.  There was no further sign of purulence.  The skin bleeders were coagulated.  Again, 3 more liters of pulse irrigation were used to clean out the knee.  After successfully accomplishing this, the arthrotomy was closed with 0 Vicryl in a watertight fashion.  The skin was then closed carefully with interrupted 3-0 nylon sutures.  A sterile consisting of Xeroform, 4x4's, Webril, and Ace wrap were applied. 
 
The patient was awakened from anesthesia.  Earlier the tourniquet had been deflated prior to closure. 
 
There were no complications during this procedure.  She was brought to the PACU in a stable condition.
