REASON FOR CONSULT:
 
1.  Goals of care. 
2.  Symptoms.  
 
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old man who has a history of high grade spindle cell sarcoma of the right buttock diagnosed in the fall of 2005.  His oncologist is Dr. **NAME[RRR] at **NAME[QQQ].  He is status post resection with negative margins in **DATE[Feb 2006] and status post XRT with 25 treatments.  At the time of diagnosis, CT scan showed a suspicious lung nodule.  The patient was advised to get adjuvant chemotherapy, however he preferred not to do that.  He was admitted on **DATE[Aug 11] with new shortness of breath and cough and was found to have bilateral pulmonary nodules, METS, and pleural effusions.  The plan for tomorrow is thoracoscopy, left wedge biopsy with drainage of pleural effusion.  
 
At the current time, the patient says he really has little symptoms.  He feels short of breath when he lays down, otherwise he has no symptoms.  Pertinent negatives include no pain, no nausea, no vomiting, no constipation, no depression, no anxiety.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
 
Former construction worker.  Former heavy alcohol use but none for several months.  No tobacco.  Has smoked marijuana.  
 
FAMILY HISTORY:
 
Mother had cancer of unknown type.  Other - The patient's contact information would be his daughter **NAME[PPP], **PHONE.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
 
The patient is sitting up in a chair, has IV fluids, looks fit and in no acute distress.  His HEENT - Muddy sclerae, moist mucous membranes.  Cardiac - Regular rate and rhythm.  Chest has decreased breath sounds.  Bilateral lung braces with no rales.  He does have dullness to percussion.  Abdomen - Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  There is no edema.  He is alert and oriented times three.  Skin - Unremarkable.  Heme and endocrine are negative.  
 
LABS:
 
Creatinine is 1.1, hematocrit is 32, white blood cell count 14.4, 86%
 neutrophils, 5% lymphocytes.  
 
ASSESSMENT:
 
This is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old African-American man with metastatic sarcoma whose main symptom is shortness of breath laying flat. 
 
PLAN:
 
1.  For pain, continue the Percocet as needed.  The patient says he is really having little to no pain. 
2.  Shortness of breath, we will not treat the symptoms at the current time.
 We will follow his breathing after the chest tube is placed.  My suspicion he will get quickly better.  
3.  The patient will likely have more pain after the procedure.  If that is the case, I would recommend a PCA, for example 1 mg IV q. eight minutes p.r.n. for pain.  We will adjust the PCA as needed.  
4.  Psych.  No current issues.  
5.  Psychosocial.  The patient has a Baptist faith.  He does not desire the minister at the current time.  
6.  Goals/dispo.  The patient places a lot of trust in Dr. **NAME[RRR] at **NAME[QQQ].  He prefers to do discussion, goals, and prognosis with him.  His main concern is he wants to know how often he has to take the chemo.  He says, "I know the chemo is going to make me sick."  However, he wants to know how long he would have to take it and if the chemo will reasonably improve his quality of life.
  Again, these are discussions he prefers to have with his oncologist, Dr.
 __________.  Of note, he has followup with Dr. **NAME[RRR] on **DATE[Sep 29].
