DATE:  **DATE[Jul 03 06]

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  RIGHT SHOULDER OSTEOARTHRITIS.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  RIGHT SHOULDER OSTEOARTHRITIS.
PROCEDURES
1. RIGHT SHOULDER HEMIARTHROPLASTY WITH DEPUY CAP PROSTHESIS.
2. RIGHT SHOULDER BICEPS TENODESIS.
ASSISTANT:  **NAME[XXX WWW], R.N.
COMPLICATIONS:  None.
DRAINS:  None.
ANESTHESIA:  Interscalene block and IV sedation.
INDICATIONS:  The patient is a **AGE[in 50s]-year-old male.  He has been difficulty with his right shoulder for 5 years.  He said, the pain is worse with activity.  He has failed conservative treatments.  He had the risks and benefits of operative and nonoperative therapy explained.  He chose to have operative intervention. 
PROSTHESIS:  DePuy, size 48 x 21 cap prosthesis.
OPERATIVE REPORT:  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in a supine position.  After administration of interscalene block and IV sedation, the shoulder was examined.  He had forward flexion to 170 degrees.  External rotation with the arm at the side was to 50 degrees.  With arm abducted, the external rotation was to 80 degrees, the internal rotation was to 50 degrees.  The load shift was grade 1 anterior and posterior.  He had negative sulcus.  The patient was then placed in a semi-Fowler position and moved to the right side of the operative table.  He was prepped with alcohol and then Betadine solution over the entire right upper extremity and draped in a sterile fashion exposing the right shoulder.  The surgeons used body exhaust gowns. 
A 10-cm incision was made from the coracoid distally along the deltopectoral level.  This was carried through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  The cephalic vein was identified and mobilized laterally.  We dissected under the pectoralis and then under the deltoid and then placed a self-retaining retractor.  The superior 1 cm of the pectoralis on the humerus was incised.  
Just medial to this, the biceps was identified and unroofed all the way up to the rotator interval, and then I incised the rotator interval.  The subscapularis was taken off the lesser tuberosity and tagged.  Then, with an extension of the external rotation, I could dislocate the humerus.  Before I did so; however, I placed the arm at the side, externally rotated, and forward flexed, and I could see the osteophytes on the inferior aspect of the humerus, and these were removed using a rongeur.  The osteophytes posteriorly removed and the anterior osteophytes removed.  I then dislocated the humerus.  I had previously trialed off the x-rays and looked like a 48 size prosthesis will be best.  I now trialed using the trials on the cap prosthesis, and the 48-size prosthesis the best.  I placed this on the patient's humerus and centered it and then placed a guidewire.  Please note that there was eburnation of bone over the entire humeral surface and loss of some bone in the central and anterior part of the humerus.  I then placed reverse reamer and reamed this down to the head and neck junction.  The excised bone around the periphery was removed leaving a shelf.  There was some loss of bone in the anterior central part of the humeral head.  I used a curette and removed the sclerotic surface of the bone until it had a bleeding surface.  I placed the trial prosthesis, and then I placed a punch for the stem.  I then removed the central pin.  I placed the trial prosthesis again, and I relocated the humerus.  I took a Bovie and incised the capsule off the labrum anteriorly and inferiorly.  Then I placed a Fukuda on the back rim of the glenoid, pushed the humerus posteriorly.  I could see the glenoid.  It was eburnated to bone.  However, it was on concentric surface.  We had decided to do a hemiarthroplasty because of the patient's activity and young age.  I then dislocated the humerus once again.  I removed the trial prosthesis.  I took some allograft bone blast and placed this in the area of the defect, and then took the 48 x 21 cap prosthesis and impacted into place.  It fit perfectly.  
The head height was excellent.  There was a small amount of excess bone in the posterosuperior humeral head, just a few millimeters that I removed using a rongeur, but otherwise it fit perfectly on the patient's proximal humerus.  
I irrigated with copious amount of antibiotic solution.  Drill holes were placed in the lesser tuberosity after the shoulder was relocated.  I checked the range of motion and the shock, both inferior and posterior; they were as with the trials.  I was happy with this.  Drill holes were placed in lesser tuberosity.  #2 Tycron sutures were placed through these drill holes, 
Mason-Allen stitches in the subscapularis. 
I did a biceps tenodesis by incising the biceps off the superior rim of the glenoid, which I had done prior.  I now tensioned it by pulling proximally with the elbow and 10 degrees of elbow flexion, and placed the back-end of these stitches through the biceps.  When I tied this down, this accomplished the biceps tenodesis and the repair of the subscapularis.  The excess biceps tendon, which was in the intraarticular portion, was excised.  The rotator interval was reapproximated.  The deltopectoral interval was reapproximated, the subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated, and the skin edges were reapproximated using a running subcuticular stitch.  The wounds were dressed in sterile fashion. 
The patient was placed in a sling and a Cryo/Cuff and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  All needle, sponge, and instrument counts were correct postoperatively.
