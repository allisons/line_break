ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Assessment: patient with ESLD, not a transplant candidate, s/p failed OTL, s/p nephrectomy for RCC and right upper lobe lobectomy for Lung cancer
- - - - -
Problem/Diagnosis 1: Abdominal pain; Plan: Related to abdominal distension. Usually comes and goes. IV opiates held because of hypotension- would suggest switching to Dilaudid 2mg q4hr PRN pain. Also to undergo paracentesis for relief of symptoms. Consider decreasing Nadolol to 20mg instead of 40mg
Problem/Diagnosis 2: nausea; Plan: Would add compazine for nausea PRN - have PO
Problem/Diagnosis 3: Disposition ; **INSTITUTION is not able to take the patient. **NAME[VVV UUU] the palliative care SW is working on getting the patient into other NH based on his preference. Cost of drugs and VRE are prohibitive factors.
