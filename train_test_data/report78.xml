HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
Chief complaint:  Shortness of breath.
Ms. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 40s]-year-old female with multiple comorbidities who is presenting with a two-month history of shortness of breath.  The patient notes that at the end of **DATE[May] of 2006, she was admitted for cardiac arrest and was subsequently intubated.  Following intubation, the patient suffered injury to the vocal cords and developed significant hoarseness and shortness of breath.  She was then seen by Dr. **NAME[TTT] from ENT at **INSTITUTION for evaluation of her shortness of breath and voice change.  Initial ENT evaluation revealed enlarged thyroid and possible left vocal cord paralysis.  Therefore, the patient underwent a CT of the neck on **DATE[Jul 04 2007] with findings of moderate multinodular thyroid goiter with retrosternal extension and tracheal compression with moderate tracheal narrowing at the level of the thoracic inlet.  Furthermore, there was subglottic airway mucosal surface nodularity.  Because of the patient's clinical presentation and CT findings, she was subsequently referred to see Dr. **NAME[SSS] of ENT at **INSTITUTION Hospital.  She was scheduled for her first appointment at the ENT clinic today.  However, after waking this morning, the patient had continued shortness of breath and was unable to dress herself or bathe herself secondary to severe shortness of breath.  Therefore, she decided to come to the Emergency Department today for evaluation.  On further questioning, the patient notes that her shortness of breath is not significantly increased or worsened today.  She denies any associated chest pain, calf tenderness, or lower extremity pain or swelling.

VITAL SIGNS:  At the time of this dictation the vital signs are not available; however, the patient was saturating approximately 98% on room air and then maintained her saturations in the range of 98 to 100% on 2 liters of nasal cannula throughout her stay in the Emergency Department. 
GENERAL APPEARANCE:  The patient is awake, alert, and oriented times three and not in any acute distress; however, she is displaying significant retraction and nasal flaring while speaking to me.

NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact.  No focal neurological deficits. 
ED COURSE:  
This is a **AGE[in 40s]-year-old female who is presenting with a long-standing history of shortness of breath.  The patient was not hypoxic and was not complaining of acute shortness of breath, chest pain, or lower extremity swelling.  
Although the patient was not displaying audible signs of stridor, her presentation was most likely consistent with upper respiratory pathology which is consistent with her ENT evaluation and neck CT findings.  ENT was called to evaluate the patient in the Emergency Department to determine the further plan.   
In the meantime, basic laboratories were obtained indicating a sodium of 145, potassium 3.9, chloride 96, bicarbonate 36, BUN 15, creatinine 5.2, and glucose of 114.  Calcium was 9.8, magnesium 1.5, and phosphorus 3.5.  White blood cell count was 8.6, hemoglobin 13.2, hematocrit 41.8, platelets 463.  
PT was 9.2, INR 1.0, PTT 34.9. 
A PA and lateral chest x-ray was also completed to rule out any acute infiltrate or effusion.  Findings on chest x-ray were significant for mild cardiac enlargement, pulmonary congestion with possible mild edema and small pleural effusions and no focal areas of infiltrate.  There were no prior films that were compared to this study. 
The patient was evaluated by ENT and it was determined that she would have to undergo surgery.  However, according to ENT, the patient warranted complete medical evaluation and clearance prior to surgery.  Therefore, it was determined that the patient should be admitted to the Medicine Service for further evaluation.  The A Service attending and resident were contacted and the case was discussed.  No further intervention was necessary for the patient while she remained in the Emergency Department.   
Of note, she is due to hemodialysis tomorrow, Friday, **DATE[Jul 12 2007].  The patient remained clinically stable and maintained her oxygen saturation on 2 liters of nasal cannula. 
DISPOSITION:
The patient was admitted to the A Service, monitored bed.  She was clinically stable throughout her stay in the Emergency Department and by the time of her transfer to the floor.  The patient was transferred to 10 South. 
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS(ES):  
SHORTNESS OF BREATH.
