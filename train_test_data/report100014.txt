Problem/Diagnosis 1: Goals; Plan: Family meeting **DATE[Nov 2 2009]  with primary team and palliative care.  Patient is dependent on 3 pressors at this point and weaning was unsuccesful.  Pt is not a candidate for VAD or heart transplant.  Decision made to continue medical management here with further attempts to wean pressors as tolerated.  We will not use bipap and will turn off ICD.  Anticipate that patient will die in the hospital.  Unfortunately, there are no other options at this point and his heart will fail at some point.  His creatnine is also worsening.  Palliative Care will follow to ensure comfort and family will call everyone who needs to come in.
