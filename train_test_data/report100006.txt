ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Assessment: **AGE[in 50s] yo woman with history of CMV pneumonia.  Intractable cough
- - - - -
Problem/Diagnosis1: 786.2: COUGH; restrictive lung disease, bronchiectasis; 
Assessment/Plans: Currently on codeine, hycodin and opioids.  Discussed with her that generally 3 of these medicines are not needed.She is willing to just be on whatever works.  Codeine appears to have worked the best for her.  MAy use uyp to 1.5 mg/kg day.  Could try and use codeine for both its anti-tussive and analgesic (not great med) effects.  Would stop hycodin.  
Problem/Diagnosis2: pain--chest, abdomen--description is not clearly musculoskeletal;  Assessment/Plans: scheduled tylenol may be helpful. Pt is on coumadin--making NSAIDs more difficult. On neurontin.  would change oxycodone to 5 q4 for 3 days and then stop--if goal is to use codeine for pain.  If wish to see if opioids are really helping her pain, could dose with 1 mg IV dialuddi and see response.  For chronic pain, opioids should opnly be increased or continued iof they provide a subjectiove improvement in pain or function improves.
Problem/Diagnosis3: depression/behavior;  Assessment/Plans: Psychiatry to see patient to better help.  I am concerned about her behaviours.  Her husband reportedly guards her medications. 
Problem/Diagnosis4: 564.00: Constipation NOS; in part secondary to opioids; 
Assessment/Plans: would continue to escalate regimen--start colace 200 bid and seena 2 bid (takes pericolace 1 bid at home)
