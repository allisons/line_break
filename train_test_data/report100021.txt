We are asked to see him by Dr. **NAME[WWW] and Dr. **NAME[VVV] for assistance in inpatient hospice management.  This is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old widowed white male whose referring diagnosis is metastatic colon cancer with mets to liver.  He is status post a perforated viscus and bilateral pulmonary embolisms.  
 
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Unable to be obtained from the patient.  
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient was diagnosed with colon cancer in **DATE[May 2009] at which time he had right hemicolectomy, ileostomy, and ureteral stent placement and underwent Folfox chemotherapy.  Unfortunately, he has had complications since that time including infected PICC and left lower lobe pneumonia.  However, he was doing reasonably well until 24 hours ago when he started to have sudden and severe pain.  He came to **INSTITUTION and was found to have perforated bowel as well as large bilateral PEs and extension of his abdominal carcinomatosis at which point patient and family opted for comfort-based care only.  He is now in patient hospice with continuous infusion of morphine.  
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above.  Also, coronary artery disease, status post stent, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis of the knee, asthma, benign prostatic hypertrophy.  
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has no tobacco or alcohol history.  
 
FAMILY HISTORY:  His family history is unobtainable from the patient.  His parents are deceased at an old age.
 
DRUG ALLERGIES:  HE HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
 
MEDICATIONS:  Currently, he is receiving IV morphine at 2 mg an hour.  
 
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Pule is 96.  Respirations are 20 and shallow.  He is tactile afebrile.  In general he is moaning.  Skin and extremities show decreased turgor.  He has pallor.  He is anicteric.  His pulses are 1+ and equal.  His HEENT is edentulous.  He is tachy.  He has no thrush.  His lymph nodes are not enlarged.  Chest shows positive rhonchi and death rattle.  Breasts show no masses.  Heart is tachycardic.  Abdomen is firm and tender with peritoneal signs.  Rectal exam was not done and not indicated.  Musculoskeletal, he has no edema.  Neurologically, he is lethargic.  Abbey Pain Scale was performed as he was unable to respond.  He was given 2 points for facial expression, 2 points for vocalization, 2 points for body language, 3 for behavior change, 3 for physical, and 2 for physiologic giving him a score of 14, which is in the severe pain range.  Discussed with staff, and they did bolus him again with 2 mg of morphine.  He did settle.  He also got a milligram of Ativan.  
 
GENERAL DIAGNOSES:  METASTATIC COLON CANCER WITH PERFORATED BOWEL, LIVER METASTASES, AND ABDOMINAL CARCINOMATOSIS.  
 
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:  BILATERAL PULMONARY EMBOLISMS, LEFT LOWER LOBE PNEUMONIA, AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, STATUS POST STENT.  
 
He is appropriate for inpatient hospice for pain management.  His prognosis is days to a week.  At the present time, I would make his bolus dose of IV morphine available q.30 minutes, not q. 1 hour.  If he uses 3 bolus doses in any 8-hour time period, I would add up his used medications and recalculate the drip rate to increase as needed.  I would make available p.r.n. enema.  He has IV Zofran if needed and the benzodiazepines as well as the Atropine drops, which I would, at this point, initiate for his death rattle.  The above has  been discussed with the staff.  
 
One hour and 30 minutes was spent on site.
