ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Assessment: **AGE[in 70s] yo female w/ a h/o ESRD s/p failed kidney transplant, CAD s/p CABG/AVR on coumadin, admitted with bleeding AV fistula with hospital course c/b SAH, small bowel volvulus, GI bleed, and STEMI, now w/ continuing abdominal pain and decreased PO intake.
1. Pain:
a) Abdominal Pain: Unclear etiology for pain - possibly secondary to recent surgery or mesenteric ischemia, as it appears to be exacerbated signficantly by PO intake. Abdominal pain is in good control with current opiate dosage.
b) Hip Pain: Recently had hip replacement. Has pain since then. Says that pain has aggravated though. Given history of bacteremia, there is chance of seeding, however, cultures have been negative for some time so it not very likely.
c) Back Pain/leg pain: Chronic. Similar in intesity as she experiences at home.
--Patient was initially started on Fentanyl and Hydromorphone PCA, but was not using PCA appropraitely. Therefore was switched to short acting oral hydromorphone for breakthtrough. pain, to which she seems to have responded. Pain is in much better control. Continue the same regimen of fentanyl patch for long acting opiate and dilaudid orally for breakthrough pain.
-- Continue amitriptyline.
2. She also appears to have a mild hypoactive delirium, possibly secondary to her acute illness/hospitalization/pain.
-- Was given 0.5mg Haldol Q8hrs. Reduced **DATE[Oct 31 2009]  to 0.5mg Q12hrs.
-- Mental status is improving.
3. Goals of Care: Met again with patient's two daughters **DATE[Nov 02 2009], including **NAME[VVV] who has been the primary spokesperson. Goals of care were discussed.
-- Patient wants to focus on two things: Pain control and staying at home.
-- Does not want artificial support, and wants to be DNR/DNI. Does not want feeding tube.
-- Prefers symptomatic relief and staying with family over life prolongation.
-- Both patient and family does not want the patient to go to a nursing home. 
-- It was decided that it will be appropraite to transfer patient to TCU for continuation of her IV antibiotics. Patient has a prognosis of weeks to months and it was communicated to the daughters. We will continue to follow the patient at TCU as well where we will help the patient and family in making decision regarding future goals of healthcare, including possible home hospice.
-- We will talk to family again **DATE[Nov 04 2009]  to assess home hospice as an option considering that she has prognosis of weeks to months, patient expresses her most imprtant priority to go home, she feels lonely and wants pain relief. Findings and plan was discussed with Dr. **NAME[XXX].
