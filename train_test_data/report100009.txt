I was asked to see Ms. **NAME[AAA] for anxiety and depression.
 
She is a **AGE[in 60s]-year-old woman with a five-year history of pulmonary sarcoid. She  is currently listed for transplant.  
 
I saw and examined the patient and discussed my plan with the patient. I  reviewed, in detail, Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU]' note and agree and link my note. I  met with the patient as well. Please see Dr. **NAME[UUU]' note in Power Chart.  Overall, our impression is that she has end-stage sarcoidosis and worsening  dyspnea. She does desaturate considerably when she walks. She has additional  stress of being far from home and concerns about her family, both emotionally  and financially. She will need ongoing psychosocial support. 
 
We are recommending a small dose of clonazepam 0.25 mg at night to start with  and then increasing to twice a day and, for depression and anxiety, I am  recommending that we start Zoloft at 50 mg at night. After seven days, we can  increase it to 100 mg. 
 
She will follow as an outpatient, both with Internal Medicine with Dr. **NAME[TTT  SSS] and Dr. **NAME[RRR]. In the outpatient setting, it would be prudent to  assess her for osteopenia and osteoporosis given her chronic steroid use. 
 
For additional psychosocial support, I will consult Behavioral Medicine,  specifically Dr. **NAME[QQQ PPP]. 
 
Please note that I spent greater than 80 minutes, greater than half the visit  face-to-face, coordinating care and counseling. 
 
 
We will continue to follow her during this hospitalization and future  hospitalizations if you wish.
