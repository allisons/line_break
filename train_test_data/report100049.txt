ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Assessment: patient with new mental obtundation after a SAH and respiratory arrest. Family do not want to rush to stop aggressive therapy and end up shortening his life and not give him any quality of life.
- - - - -
Problem/Diagnosis 1: Upper airway secretions; Plan: continues to be on PRN robinul, currently not an issue
Problem/Diagnosis 2: Mental Status change; Plan: Mental status has so far not recovered from respiratory arrest last week, seizure activity detected and controlled but antiseizure medications. Discussed case with Neurology who feel that patient is in an interictal state and would benefit from  address of metabolic issues that would impact his mental status including UTI, ?ongoing aspiration, also shows increase in WBC count today.
Problem/Diagnosis 3: Goals of care; Plan: Family wanting to get a PEG tube if the NG tube is likely to be needed. They would also like Neurology to address the issue about CEA for the Carotid artery stenosis- I discussed with Neurology who feel that it would be a decision to be made in 4-5 weeks from now.
